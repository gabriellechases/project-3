"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [January 27, 2020]","Hey there honorary Justice League members - it‚Äôs a new week which means it‚Äôs time for a new discussion thread!

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week‚Äôs releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Green Lantern* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Green Lantern"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Anyone caught posting unwarranted top level comments will be flaired and publicly shamed.  

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Christopher Priest has been doing a great job with *Deathstork*, and I'm excited to see him write an encounter against Duck Grayson and Batmallard!""

**QUICK LINKS:**

[Discussion]: Making a Golden Age Batman Essentials List.,"So recently I've been putting my DCUniverse subscription to good use, and reading some of the comics again. I know I've only scratched the surface, but I finally finished reading through the most notable and recommended Post-Crisis Batman stories (Starting with Year One, going through with Long Halloween and Year Two and whatnot, all the way until the New 52 Starts. Also, I reread TDKReturns at the end, but I've been reading that for 20 years). I've already read through most New 52 stuff and Rebirth stuff (Since I only really fell out of the comics a few years back), so that leaves the Pre-Crisis stuff. So I'm beginning with the Golden Age. And I was wondering, what are the stories you would consider essential to the Golden Age experience?

Currently I already have a few listed and read. I have Detective Comics #27-38 already read, and Batman #1-25 (All very recommended to me) on standby, with me already having read Batman #1 a few years back. But these only cover his first few years. So after that (Up until ""Under the Red Hood"", which I have listed as my end goad since that's when the Golden Age seems to end in a lot of ways), what are your thoughts on some of his best stories there?

*P.S. I'm a big Riddler fan if that helps.*",DCcomics

Why are DC‚Äôs trades organized so weirdly?,"I have been getting really frustrated with the way DC puts together trade paperbacks. If anyone has any info as to *why* they do it this way, I'd love to hear it, but tbh this is mostly just me venting.

I've been going through the trade paperbacks for Tynion's Detective run and they're mostly fine, but a few things are absolutely maddening. The worst thing is that, for some reason, the issues are not always presented in the order they came out. Like, volume 5 includes issues 963-968. But they're presented in this order: 965, 966, 967, 968, 963, 964. *WHY???* The same basic thing happened in volume 4. The Stephanie Brown-centric issues get put at the back for some reason--maybe because they're co-written?--and it fucks with the continuity between stories.

Then there is the stuff that is more standard but I find annoying anyways: no table of contents, no issue numbers given in the book, backup stories are cut out and placed at the end of the book. It feels like the comic book equivalent of watching an old pan-and-scan movie on TV. Like, barring some fuckup that happened during the initial publishing, just show me the stories how they were originally presented.",DCcomics

I really want GL Earth One, but it's only available in hardcover. Some of the other Earth One books are in TPBs, so I'd hoped that GL would eventually as well... but it's been a very long time and it's still hardcover only.

"Where does the ""Batman works alone"" myth even comes from?","Batman debuted on May 1939, Robin debuted on April 1940, 11 issues after Batman, and not even a year after the latter's debut.

Robin debuted before, and not limited to: Joker, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Penguin, Two-Face, Riddler, Mad Hatter, Clayface, Mr Freeze, Poison Ivy, Alfred, Leslie Thompkins, Lucius Fox, Vicki Vale, Wayne Enterprises, the Batcave, the Bat-Signal, heck, Robin debuted before Gotham City was even CALLED Gotham.

There are precisely 6 elements from the Batman mythos that still remains to this day that debuted before Robin: Batman himself, his origin story, Commissioner Gordon, Hugo Strange, the Batmobile and Wayne Manor.

But despite all of this, it's a persistent claim among casuals that ""Batman works alone"" and that ""Batman should go back to being a solo crimefighter"".

Why is that?",DCcomics

[Question] So are the Lantern suits constructs or not?,"Okay, so I know that they used to be physical, but what about now? Also, I don't know anything about the lanterns.

They appear on the persons body like a construct, but they can also be ripped and torn. Jon Stewart physically took his mask off and told Hal he wasn't going to wear it which seems like it was a real costume. They have other colors than green in the costume and if I am correct, they stay on the user even when out of power.

But, they also appear on the user, they're comics where someone drains the lantern's power and the suit starts to disappear as well. 

I've heard a theory that the suit is real and goes into a pocket dimension when not being worn. But what is the actual answer?",DCcomics

[Discussion]: Shazam Rebirth has actually been Post-Doomsday Clock this whole time,"&amp;#x200B;

[Gary Frank Variant Cover for Shazam #1](https://preview.redd.it/qw3hk74flid41.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd6ee9a7d271858beee236076af3499cd6bf36e9)

Although most continuity books still hasn't caught up to it, (refer to my previous posts for more on that) there's already some that are set after Doomsday Clock or in the new Post-DDC timeline.

The big one was of course, **Wonder Woman #750's Brave New World** by Scott Snyder and Bryan Hitch, which covers the new status quo of Diana being the first public hero just before the JSA.

Before we look at Shazam, let's take a look at that first.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Moment](https://preview.redd.it/j1ko7b5j2id41.png?width=1041&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94a32ff2dd07c34c4772cb872954e06a0a68f581)

&amp;#x200B;

[Alan Scott](https://preview.redd.it/ttg0jokt2id41.png?width=738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d9dcea427af96672146838a70acc6d5522361a8)

As the leaked timeline and 5G rumors said, multiple eras resembling previous continuities are now in this new universe. Including a Golden Age Wonder Woman.

Now some people who didn't notice or remember this but this was introduced by DDC #12:

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""Arrival of Wonder Woman, who fought alongside the Justice Society of America during World War II\\""](https://preview.redd.it/hy2e297a3id41.png?width=138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9998998b3b06b73741e19e67d8aac433d12fb2ef)

So yes, Doomsday Clock's impact is already being felt and more are on the way. Note however that the rest of the book and continuity aren't following this yet because DDC is still ahead.  This story is likely a sneak peek at the JSA book that Scott's been wanting to do soon. The Kents are set to make an appearance in a similar scenario in Bendis' Heroes and Villains One-Shot and Jason Fabok's Golden Age like batsuit art for 3 Jokers proves even more that it's Post-DDC.

&amp;#x200B;

[So nope they're not going to stay dead](https://preview.redd.it/b0x3vpqa4id41.png?width=665&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=128e66dd45c1e074e990418abc8f46c85908c73e)

[An Homage to Batman #1](https://preview.redd.it/c7ryt2n34id41.png?width=818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ea5c1ed98b6f2866a6c5d2af696da0bed7b79f3)

**""Okay but what about Shazam? The comic this post is titled after?""**

Alright. After some thinking and reviewing, I think Geoff's Rebirth Shazam run was actually after all current continuity, including Year of the Villain AND Doomsday Clock **THIS. WHOLE. TIME.**

Now as you might know, Superboy Prime is coming back in Shazam:

&amp;#x200B;

[Shazam #13 Cover](https://preview.redd.it/ffrd5ys65id41.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f98fa8cf1aa7d0bed3a950bf1fe8868390fd945b)

Only for him to return earlier in #10 recently:

&amp;#x200B;

[Prime Time](https://preview.redd.it/tadx2e2g5id41.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecb20c80f54432b67ad823d8c6dbc725acded4df)

He even remembers Mr. Mind's old Venus origin and broke the fourth wall again, as he's aware of the New 52.

Geoff finally opened up on the topic in an interview:

[https://www.newsarama.com/48752-geoff-johns-says-it-s-the-perfect-time-to-bring-superboy-prime-to-shazam-10.html](https://www.newsarama.com/48752-geoff-johns-says-it-s-the-perfect-time-to-bring-superboy-prime-to-shazam-10.html)

Among the things he's said, was that the JSA will be coming to #14 fresh from DDC to help out:

&gt;‚ÄúFirst off, what better villain to fight the world‚Äôs greatest superhero kid, Shazam, than the world‚Äôs worst superhero villain kid, Superboy-Prime?‚Äù Johns told Newsarama. ‚ÄúAnd then in¬†**Shazam! #14**,¬†**the¬†Justice Society of America¬†will be coming by to help, fresh from**¬†***Doomsday Clock***. Alan, Jay, Stargirl, Cyclone ‚Äî the whole gang will be coming by. So the book‚Äôs going to get a little more crowded.‚Äù

So Shazam #14 is definitely post-Clock in that case, and unless there's a time skip between issues, it's most definitely the case from issue 1.

There are hints of this that we never noticed.

Let's take a look back.

[From Black Adam Year of the Villain](https://preview.redd.it/4hifnlxe6id41.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d4d67befca66e4b80652d9d2e355dae225e5ddb8)

While he was Infected Billy was fully capable of saying his magic word (and name) without transforming as the New 52 established the intent requirement. Hence he could use it as his name and everyone refers to him as such.

Why does that matter?

In Shazam Rebirth:

[Trouble saying his name?](https://preview.redd.it/2w2lwy767id41.png?width=1332&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3182229e39c507c8e61cf3337609c54d4c36d2ee)

Billy now has trouble saying the word without transforming which is why he's trying to think of a new name in the first issue. Something like, I don't know, **Captain Marvel:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Captain Marv-](https://preview.redd.it/4jgt7gtk7id41.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8d06cd3b07d2d9515a6cfc66ee728ba732e94b)

There's been tons of foreshadowing since then that he'll get the name back, some less subtle than others:

&amp;#x200B;

[Captain Marvel?](https://preview.redd.it/kvm5vpmv7id41.png?width=510&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96fa5b86db36e409f77f82c2424637a549857be7)

&amp;#x200B;

[Familiar looking costumes those old Champions have](https://preview.redd.it/tylot1d28id41.png?width=746&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=386e4daa0f560c295f56d73508c5349ec73106b0)

There's nothing that implies that this happened yet in current books as Billy is Infected meaning whatever caused this hasn't happened yet.

Clearly though this current run is making a transition from New 52 Shazam to something closer to classic Captain Marvel, with the old names and costumes being hinted at and even the Monster Society of Evil making a comeback and SBP knowing about their original origins.

Even Billy himself is back to a more classic personality instead of his bratty self in the New 52 and Infected while also embracing his family way more. Now we all assumed that this was because of simple character growth over time which is true, but the fact that he stayed the same way from his origin all the way to Infected showed that this book takes place after and with a direction of honoring the past once more, which is what Rebirth is all about.

&amp;#x200B;

**So in conclusion, Geoff's current Shazam run is most definitely after YOTV and DDC.**

Which is really interesting and explains why the book is the way it is in many ways.

As for Prime, he was likely freed after the Source Wall's destruction and likely got to the magic lands in the time between then and now. This means of course that he likely won't be able to reality punch continuity errors unfortunately but we'll see.",DCcomics

From little images and scans I've seen it appears as if Billy is at least aware that some version of him was called 'Captain Marvel', and I think SBP mentioning that is one of the things will finally push Billy into taking back that name.",DCcomics

WB Montreal Batman Game,"With the official reveal of the game right around the corner anyone have any wishlists for the game?

9/10 WB Montreal is going to use the Arkham Knight engine so my hope is that they reduce (or even take out) the Batmobiles involvance in the upcoming game.

One big thing I want back that they messed up in Knight is in-game DLC stories that tie into the campaign. Catwoman's DLC in City was great and gave it that Directors cut feel for the game. If they can do that with any character (maybe Selina's Catwoman origins) I would buy that day one.

The game is most likely in post production right now but WB MONTREAL had to be taking notes after Knight on what worked and what didn't.

Thoughts?",DCcomics

Scott Snyder's Justice League - any good?,"I've been wanting a good run on Justice League for ages; I fell out of love with the League during the New 52 and haven't picked up again through Rebirth. I liked Snyder's Batman run in N52 but couldn't get behind Dark Knights: Metal, it was all a bit 'out there' for me.

Also, I can't stand Cyborg. Sorry, but he doesn't belong in the League. He's just so ... robotic, so bland, so stiff. Not a big fan of Hal either, and was encouraged to see John Stewart back on the cover for Snyder's book. Debating whether to get it.",DCcomics

When I first started collecting comics in the 90s, I remember thinking how unfair it was that she only had 1 title while Superman and Batman each had 4.

Jason Todd was killed off in 1988. So, my guess is: Tim was born in the mid-70s. Jason and Dick sometime in the late-60s or early-70s.
This still doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Regardless of the fact, Tim will still be an adult by the time Jason Todd returns as Red Hood.

SPOILER! How Batman: Curse of The White Knight could ending (In my Opinion),"Hello everyone,

I've read now every issue of Batman Curse of the White Knight, and one thing had me realley touched: The Relationship between Batman and Harley. 

In this universe they have so much chemistry togheter and after issue 6 we know that Harley choose Batman over Jack because she finally realized that Joker will be never dissapear completly from Jack. The only way to give her, and her twins a savety live is to kill Joker, and that's why she killed him, i think ü§î

So, now with Jack/Joker gone, is only one man that could possibly destroy Harleys Future with Batman and that's Azrael!!

I've read the officially description of Issue 8 and i'm thinking i know how Curse of the White Knight Could end:

After thier brutal Fight through Gotham City, Batman realizes the only way to save Gotham once and for all is to break his Moral Codex and to kill Azrael. After he had kill Azrael, he eventually give up beeing Batman completly and gave the title too Someone else. (that would be fit in the Story for the confirmed third Book: Batman Beyond The White Knight)

In the End for my opinion is the greatest way to Bring Batman and Harley umtimatively togheter with Bruce as Partner/Husband for her, and a Father for the Twins.

That was my Ending for Curse of The White Knight, what did you thinking about? Let me guess in the Comments:)

Hope you'r enjoyed that",DCcomics
Donna Troy &amp; Wonder Girl in Rebirth,"Hi everyone,
I have gotten into comics a short time ago and started reading TPB‚Äôs mostly from the New52 (only Justice League &amp; Batman) and Rebirth

Now I became interested in Wonder Woman after buying several 750th variants, so I read the first 4 Volumes of her Rebirth run (that should be Ruckas complete rebirth saga?)

I read about Donna Troy and Cassie on the Internet and because they weren‚Äòt even mentionned in the stories I want to ask where they are at the moment?
Do they appear later in the Wonder Woman stories or are they in any other Team books, like Titans, teen Titans, Young justice...?

What does editorial...do anymore? (Year of the Villain spoilers),"Since Rebirth, DC has come out and said they are allowing creators to tell their stories not bogged down by continuity, or other books changes. Which is good in individual stories, and prevents like what happened with N52 Nightwing, the series always getting interupted by Events.  But this new attitude is absolutely horrible when they try to do cross series events. This was made super apparent by the Year of the Villain

Batman saw the Doom Sigil appear in 3 or 4 different series. He was getting his ass beat in Kings batman the same time he was in space with the Justice league, at the same time he was in his casual civies in gotham in Outsiders. 

The flash was locked up in central city, and wakes up with no knowledge of how the city became covered in ice and taken over, and no idea what the doom sigil is, at the same time he was going through time with the Justice League, and saw the sigil with them?

Its gotten so bad with this event that it takes away any sort of seriousness or effect this event is supposed to have. If you have a cross series event happen in every book, shouldnt you make them line up? Isnt that what editorial should do, and used to? 

In old Pre-n52 events like No Mans Land and the Crisis's, editorial had dialogue even line up across books, and everything fit together. Now its just an open season where any creator can do anything, even tied to an event, and who cares if it lines up. Which IMO ruins any sort of effect these events are supposed to have. Its all a mess. 

Opinions? Agree, disagree?",DCcomics

"DC Comic binge: Is it worth starting the very, very, VERY beginning?","So, just like how Arrowverse fans create watch list of all of the Arrowverse episodes like: Arrow ep 1, The Flash ep 1, Arrow ep 2, The Flash ep 2, etc. in case of crossovers for instance. Say, I wanted to binge EVERY SINGLE DC Comics published books from the VERY beginning like Action Comics #1 or whatever, by going on the wiki, research every single comic from the golden age, the silver age, the bronze age and onward and write them down in a checklist by date until the 12-part Crisis On Infinite Earths miniseries. I know it might be rigorous, but is it worth it, or will it screw with my mind at this point if I tried to consume it all?

I'm not a comic reader, but if I wanna read the comics published by DC, I would definitely wanna start from the VERY beginning and read all in order and to see how things progress. I know not ALL of it will be good, but still, I'll judge for myself.

I mean, how many comic book readers today know that for all of his endless speechifying about ""I don't use guns, I hate guns,"" Batman not only carried a gun on some of his earliest adventures he shot and killed a few people with it?

How the fuck do you cram that into continuity in any logical way?",DCcomics
Wonder woman bloodlines,I noticed no one is talking about the newest dc comics animated feature here. I'd be interested to know how other received it.

Is there a definitive list of the N52 trades anywhere?,"I only ask because I have been using three websites. [Crushing Krisis](https://crushingkrisis.com/crushing-comics-guide-collecting-dc-comic-books/dc-new-52-definitive-collecting-guide/), [Reading Orders](http://www.readingorders.com/Collections/TheNew52) and [Comic Book Herald](https://www.comicbookherald.com/reading-dc-comics/new-52-reading-order/) and from a collectors point of view there are so many discrepancies.

Did the N52 only use black spines or did they go to a new format later on? is that still considered N52 or is it up for debate?

I thought I was nearing the end of my collection and was getting excited to start collecting for the SEGA Master System..

Any help or advice would be awesome (advising me to collect something other than the N52 is also advice)",DCcomics

Advice for someone who wants to start reading the comics?,"I've watched all the DC TV shows but I'm mainly an Arrowverse fan. Even though I've watched everything I feel like I'm missing out on a lot because I never read the comics. Thing is, how tf do I start, going by the fact that the DC comics go all the way back to the 1930s and I'll never be able to read all of them. 
While watching some things really get confusing if you don't know the whole story and I just want to get in the loop.

Is Perpetua going to take on the Endless? Specifically Destiny?,"I'm admittedly no expert on Perpetua, but to achieve her goals and change the fate of the multiverse, could she be trying to gather enough power to take on Destiny himself? The endless are OP as anything, and Destiny was already involved in Dark Knights metal, so maybe they will be brought more centre stage as everything hits the fan?

Just an idea, as Perpetua is probably going straight for the source (pun intended), but I just thought this might be a cool way of her achieving her goal without going against the source's weird comic space raven thing (that I believe 1 shot her last time but don't quote me on that). 

I know that the Endless wouldn't go for a direct confrontation, but if Perpetua specifically went and attacked Destiny, could she amass enough force to take his book? With that book could she challenge the Presence's plans? Could she subjugate an Endless in attempt to fight the source? Would the other Endless sit back since Destiny would surely have seen this coming and didn't ask them to help?

I'm no comic expert, so please let me know what you think of this little fan theory. :)",DCcomics

So... what‚Äôs the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù batman origin now?,"So, i just finished reading Tom King‚Äôs run on batman, and i‚Äôm pretty confused about the whole Year one/Zero year stuff. 
For example, zero year is referenced multiple times, so i initially guessed that was the new ‚Äúofficial‚Äù origin for batman. 
But then catwoman actually references a scene from year one (‚Äúwe met on the street, you had a scar, yadda yadda‚Äù)
Also, things like the war of jokes and riddles which apparently take place approximately one year after ‚Äúzero year‚Äù really confuse me... did the long halloween not happen anymore? The relationship between the villains and characters seem really different.
I‚Äôm mainly confused about this stuff because i know new 52 rebooted most of the continuity, but i thought dc rebirth actually restored pretty much all the stuff we lost since flashpoint. 
Can anyone give me some clarity?",DCcomics

Am i the only one who likes comics but doesn't care about movies ?,"Before you downvote me to death , let me explain myself.


I love DC comics , but i have apathy for DC films , except for Joker. More on that later.

I'm one of those people whom still collects physical copies of movies ; DVD/Blu-Ray. But with DC movies it's a rather unusual case. I have MoS , BvS , and Suicide Squad in my collection. After these , i simply stopped collecting them. I still was going to movie theatres for them.


I love Wonder Woman despite it's weak ending. Thing is , when Wonder Woman hit the home media , i didn't feel like buying it. Same with Justice League ; was in theatre , didn't buy disc.

I watched Aquaman and highly enjoyed it. But , again , it's not in my collection.

I have seen all of the above on the premiere day


Shazam was more or less a turning point. I had schedule problems , and couldn't see it on premiere day. When i finally had time for it , i felt nothing. There are movies which I can't see on the premiere day , but i am still excited about them.

When seeing the first Birds of Prey trailer , i felt nothing. And i still feel nothing about them , even after seeing the second trailer. I am not even excited for James Gunn's Suicide Squad.


There is only one exception. Joker. This movie captivated me before and after the premiere. It's great ; it's better than any Marvel movie. Wonder Woman &amp; Aquaman are better than some Marvel movies. I nearly cried during this film , my dad , like me , loved it more than any movie that we watched together in 2019. He nearly cried three(!) times during it , to say that it's rather unusual for him would be understatement. I plan on buying it when it hits the home media.



Is there anyone like me , or am i the only one ?

Edit to add : i also have apathy about WW1984.",DCcomics

Detective Comics Passing Action Comics Number of issues makes me (slightly) sad.,"First of all I admit this is really stupid but its (slightly) sad that action comics got overtaken by detective comics in issue numbering. I understand that batman is DCs big gun now (for a while now), but it was nice that Action Comics had more issues. Kind of felt respectfull to the fact that Superman was the first Superhero. Maybe Im just a bit salty that they did this for Bendis. 

This is obviously a minor thing. Not really a problem. Just wanted to see if anyone else shared the same sentiment, or their thoughts.

Edit: Multiple comments have made me aware that detective comics is actually older anyway. Didnt know that, thanks.",DCcomics

[Spoilers] I just finished Batman Damned...,"I went in knowing little about Damned, only hearing that it was pretty good, but was delightfully surprised when first John Constantine showed up, then Zatanna, and even Swamp Thing.  I‚Äôve been working my way through Justice League Dark so I feel super connected to these characters already and want to read everything they‚Äôre in.  

I only have one gripe, Zatanna‚Äôs spellcasting.  Through everything zatanna I‚Äôve read she casts her spells by saying words backwards but still in the correct order of a sentence, tsuj ekil siht.  But my brain was spinning trying to read her spells in damned because her spells whole sentence was backward!   

I haven‚Äôt read a ton of comics with zatanna in it, which I plan on going into soon, but does each writer switch around the way she casts spells or was this just an oversight on the writers of Damned. 

I know that‚Äôs a tiny nitpick, but other than that I really enjoyed the series",DCcomics
The Flash Season 3 Fan Made Pitch Meeting (Based off of Screen Rant‚Äôs Pitch Meetings),"The Flash Season 3 Fan Made Pitch Meeting (Based off of Screen Rant‚Äôs Pitch Meetings)


Producer: So, you have a Season 3 of the Flash for me?

Screenwriter: Yes sir, I do. So remember at the end of last season when Barry saved his mom?

Producer: It‚Äôs all I talked about with my friends. I loved it.

Screenwriter: Great. So we‚Äôre gonna open the season with Barry in this new timeline where everything is different.

Producer: Everything is different?

Screenwriter: Yeah. Everything.

Producer: So Oliver Queen isn‚Äôt the Green Arrow? 

Screenwriter: He‚Äôs not seen or mentioned, so maybe.

Producer: Harrison Wells is still alive? 

Screenwriter: He‚Äôs not seen or mentioned, so maybe.

Producer: John Diggle is Green Lantern?

Screenwriter: He‚Äôs not seen or mentioned, so maybe.

Producer: Who is seen or mentioned?

Screenwriter: Well, Cisco is the rich head of S.T.A.R. Labs, and Wally is the new Flash.

Producer: Right. Because Barry isn‚Äôt a speedster anymore.

Screenwriter: No. He‚Äôs still a speedster.

Producer: How?

Screenwriter: Because I need him to be.

Producer: Why?

Screenwriter: So he can have a fight at the climax of the episode.

Producer: Fair enough. 

Screenwriter: But he is slowly losing his speed and memories.

Producer: Oh my god.

Screenwriter: Yeah. The Reverse-Flash tells him the only way to stop this is to go back and let his mother die.

Producer: Oh yeah, what happened to the Reverse-Flash?

Screenwriter: Well, Barry took him to the new timeline and imprisoned him in cage somewhere in a storage area. 

Producer: I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs no toilet?

Screenwriter: There‚Äôs not.

Producer: How has no one come across this area?

Screenwriter: I don‚Äôt know. 

Producer: Fair enough.

Screenwriter: Also, when he‚Äôs talking to Barry he says he‚Äôll call this reality ‚ÄúFlashpoint.‚Äù

Producer: Why does he call it that?

Screenwriter: Because it was a popular comic book event.

Producer: That‚Äôs true. Flashpoint was pretty popular. It‚Äôs going to be really interesting where we‚Äôre gonna go with this storyline.

Screenwriter: So at the end of the episode Wally gets really injured, and Barry realizes that everyone‚Äôs lives are now worse. So he goes to the Reverse-Flash and undoes Flashpoint.

Producer: Wait. That‚Äôs it? Only one episode of Flashpoint? Why?

Screenwriter: Because everyone‚Äôs lives are worse in that timeline. Joe is depressed and an alcoholic, Wally‚Äôs really hurt. I mean everyone is just miserable.

Producer: You said Cisco‚Äôs the rich head of S.T.A.R. Labs. He doesn‚Äôt sound very miserable. Also Barry‚Äôs parents are both alive and happy. Don‚Äôt they get a say in the affairs?

Screenwriter: Look at my back sir.

Producer: Okay.

Screenwriter: Do you see anything?

Producer: No.

Screenwriter: Oh that‚Äôs good, because I thought I saw you on it a minute ago. Could you make sure not to get on it?

Producer: Okay. I‚Äôll keep away from it.

Screenwriter: Thanks. So Barry comes back to find that everything is different.

Producer: Everything is different? Are we still in Flashpoint?

Screenwriter: No we‚Äôre out of Flashpoint. But a ton of people‚Äôs lives are different. Like Iris isn‚Äôt talking to Joe, Cisco‚Äôs brother died, and Diggle‚Äôs daughter is a boy now.

Producer: Diggle‚Äôs daughter had a sex change? 

Screenwriter: No. She‚Äôs literally a boy now. Like Felicity showed Barry a picture of baby John Diggle Jr. and he was originally Sara Diggle before Flashpoint.

Producer: Wow. That‚Äôs pretty disturbing. I bet they‚Äôre both pretty horrified.

Screenwriter: No I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre more weirded out and exhausted.

Producer: Felicity‚Äôs not freaking out that her friend‚Äôs daughter got erased from existence?

Screenwriter: You‚Äôd think she would but no.

Producer: What does freak her out?

Screenwriter: Lying to her freaks her out.

Producer: Oh yeah. She does lash out when people lie to her.

Screenwriter: Also, Barry has this new coworker in his forensics lab named Julian.

Producer: Oh, what‚Äôs his deal?

Screenwriter: Well he hates Barry because he doesn‚Äôt like things he doesn‚Äôt trust.

Producer: I forgot to ask. Who is the big bad of this season?

Screenwriter: I‚Äôm glad you asked. We‚Äôre gonna have two characters as the big bad of this season.

Producer: Two big bads?

Screenwriter: Two big bads.

Producer: Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.

Screenwriter: One of the big bads is called Alchemy. And he‚Äôs contacting all of the people who were Meta-Humans in Flashpoint and giving them their powers back. His identity is also going to be kept a secret for a bit.

Producer: Is it Julian?

Screenwriter: Oh how did you know?

Producer: Well, you did introduce a new major character out of nowhere.

Screenwriter: That‚Äôs true. I did.

Producer: Who‚Äôs the other big bad?

Screenwriter: The other big bad of the season is Savitar. 

Producer: And what‚Äôs his deal?

Screenwriter: He‚Äôs an evil speedster from the future who has a grudge against Barry.

Producer: Didn‚Äôt we already have two evil speedsters as the big bad of season 1 and 2?

Screenwriter: We did. And he‚Äôs gonna be voiced by Tobin Bell like how Zoom was voiced by Tony Todd when disguised.

Producer: Well, Saw is a scary movie.

Screenwriter: It is, and we find out in the seventh episode that Alchemy was just a lackey.

Producer: Didn‚Äôt you say that we would be getting two big bads this season?

Screenwriter: Oh whoops.

Producer: Whoopsie.

Screenwriter: And his identity is going to be kept in secret for as well.

Producer: For how long?

Screenwriter: Until the end of episode 20.

Producer: But there are only 23 episodes in the season. Shouldn‚Äôt there be more time dedicated to future Barry?

Screenwriter: I didn‚Äôt tell you it was future Barry.

Producer: I just assumed. Is it future Barry?

Screenwriter: It is future Barry. You rapscallion, You!

Producer: Shouldn‚Äôt there be more time dedicated to who is under the mask?

Screenwriter: Sir are you sure there‚Äôs nothing on my back?

Producer: I don‚Äôt think there is.

Screenwriter: Oh phew. Just checking. I thought you were on it again.

Producer: I‚Äôm not.

Screenwriter: Thanks.

Producer: No problem.

Screenwriter: I‚Äôm sure Savitar will be great. I have a few designs in mind...

Producer: That reminds me. I wanted to hand you a picture of what I want the big bad to look like.

Screenwriter: Oh interesting.

Producer: Yeah. Here you go.

Screenwriter: This is a picture of Megatron from the Transformers movies.

Producer: Yeah. 

Screenwriter: You like Megatron?

Producer: Oh. Megatron is tight! Can you do that for me?

Screenwriter: You want me to make Megatron the big bad of the season?

Producer: No, I want you to make the big bad look like Megatron.

Screenwriter: Like how similar?

Producer: I don‚Äôt know. Surprise me.

Screenwriter: I‚Äôll try. So later in the mid season finale Barry accidentally travels to the future and witnesses Savitar kill Iris.

Producer: Oh my god.

Screenwriter: Yeah. So the rest of the season is the team figuring out how they prevent this from happening.

Producer: Oh I bet they‚Äôll be extra cautious. 

Screenwriter: You‚Äôd think so but they kind of do a lot of dumb things.

Producer: Like what?

Screenwriter: Like them not telling Joe until later, Wally seeing visions of Savitar and not saying anything, and him accidentally releasing Savitar from the Speed Force and taking his place.

Producer: Yikes. Kind of clumsy on their part.

Screenwriter: So true. And Barry has to go into the speed force to save Wally, but the speed force won‚Äôt let him, so Jay Garrick takes his place instead.

Producer: Oh its gonna be hard to get him out now since they tried to break in already.

Screenwriter: Actually it‚Äôs gonna be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.

Producer: Oh really?

Screenwriter: Yeah, Barry‚Äôs just going to quickly get him out without any problems.

Producer: Well okay then. 

Screenwriter: Also, We‚Äôre gonna have Jesse join the team for a just few episodes because she‚Äôs a speedster now too.

Producer: Just a few episodes? Why only a few?

Screenwriter: Because when she fights Savitar, he says that he has big plans for her. So she leaves to stay on Earth-3.

Producer: What were his big plans for her?

Screenwriter: I don‚Äôt know. 

Producer: Fair enough. Hey, can we have a crossover with Supergirl?

Screenwriter: We‚Äôre already having one. She‚Äôs in the official crossover with Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow.

Producer: Can we put her in another crossover as well with the Flash?

Screenwriter: What kind of crossover are we talking?

Producer: A musical.

Screenwriter: A musical?

Producer: A musical. What could be more amazing than a musical? With song and dance, and sweet romance, and happy endings happening by happenstance.

Screenwriter: Both what you‚Äôre suggesting and what you said sounded like Something Rotten.

Producer: Do you want the musical episode or not?

Screenwriter: Not really. It doesn‚Äôt really factor into the story I‚Äôm writing.

Producer: Well I‚Äôd prefer if you did it anyway. Plus if you brought Darren Criss to play the villain that would be great.

Screenwriter: Why Darren Criss?

Producer: Because Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoist were on Glee, and so was he. People remember Glee.

Screenwriter: People do remember Glee.

Producer: Yep. So forgettable yet so memorable.

Screenwriter: So anyway...

Producer: I remember Glee.

Screenwriter: So anyway because of Flashpoint, Caitlin has developed frost powers and a split personality called Killer Frost is slowly emerging.

Producer: Killer Frost is an alternate personality?

Screenwriter: Yep. So this is going to make Caitlin do evil things. Like try to kill Barry and help Savitar.

Producer: Why can‚Äôt she do those things on her own? Why do the frost powers turn her evil?

Screenwriter: Unclear.

Producer: Well okay then.

Screenwriter: And we‚Äôre also going to bring in a new Harrison Wells from Earth-19 called HR. And he‚Äôs a total moron who accidentally reveals to the team that he‚Äôs not really a genius and lied to them.

Producer: Wow. So I guess the team has to find a new Wells.

Screenwriter: Nope. They keep him around.

Producer: Why?

Screenwriter: Because.

Producer: That works.

Screenwriter: And he‚Äôs also a chatterbox who gets on people‚Äôs nerves. He also casually tells Savitar that Iris is hiding on Earth-2 even though Barry is not even allowed to know.

Producer: Wow. He sounds like much more of a liability than an asset.

Screenwriter: Well he makes up for it by disguising himself as Iris to take her place as Savitar‚Äôs victim.

Producer: I guess the team must be pretty devastated to see him die. There must be a lot of tears.

Screenwriter: There should be, but none of the main characters really mind.

Producer: What?

Screenwriter: Yeah. Barry says there‚Äôll be time to mourn, and no one really even cries at his funeral.

Producer: Wow. That seems kinda mean.

Screenwriter: It does. So since Savitar needed to kill Iris to ensure his existence, he‚Äôs slowly going to wiped away from existence by the speed force. So he and Killer Frost kidnap Cisco to make him build a gun that lets him be in multiple places at once throughout time, but Barry and the team find him in the woods and stop him before he can do that. 

Producer: Oh my god.

Screenwriter: And Barry takes control of the Savitar suit and pushes Future Barry out of it.

Producer: Is he gonna sound like Tobin Bell now?

Screenwriter: No he‚Äôs gonna sound like himself.

Producer: So is it just Future Barry who does that voice or does the suit have a feature that allows him to sound like Jigsaw?

Screenwriter: I don‚Äôt know.

Producer: Fair enough.

Screenwriter: So Savitar tries to kill Barry one last time, but Iris shoots him in the back and he dies.

Producer: So happy endings now?

Screenwriter: Almost. See since Jay left the speed force, it needs someone to take its place. So Barry is forced to go into the Speed Force.

Producer: Oh. Poor Iris.

Screenwriter: Poor Iris indeed. And just when they got engaged.

Producer: Oh that‚Äôs so sad. She deserves love, even when it‚Äôs with her adoptive brother. That‚Äôs still kinda creepy by the way. 

Screenwriter: So true on all three things you just said sir.

Producer: Yeah.

Screenwriter: So what do you think? 

Producer: I think it‚Äôs great.

Screenwriter: You do?

Producer: Yeah, and I think the fans will enjoy the darker atmosphere. Heck, they might even call it better then the first two seasons.

Screenwriter: Oh, I think you might be right!",DCcomics

Which characters have the clearest headcanon timelines?,"Someone like Batman is pretty easy to nail down a headcanoned timeline of their iconic stories and events. Something like; Year One, Long Halloween, Robin Year One, Batgirl Year One, etc. Going all the way up to stuff like Court of Owls.

The same's true for the likes of Green Lantern, The Justice League, or even the Teen Titans if you ignore the New 52's retcons.

But other characters like Wonder Woman and Aquaman are lost on me. Is that just a blindspot of my own because I haven't been exposed to their famous stories, or is it due to a lot of retcons and history shifting.

Even Superman is a bit of an enigma trying to plot out his famous stories. You've got the Smallville years/ LoSH, him arriving in Metropolis, Supergirl, Death of Superman, etc. But it's not as clear or concise as a Batman timeline would be. Does anyone else have this?",DCcomics

Characters You Wouldn't Mind Being Racebent?,"Permanently, in the comics.

A part of me wishes DC would racebend Selena Kyle as black. A lot of people who don't read comics think she's black. Eartha's version of her is iconic, the Catwoman in the stand-alone movie is often mistake for Selena, and Selena is sometimes black in adaptations. Anecdotally, I had to explain to family that Fish Mooney from Gotham *wasn't* Catwoman. Selena's character and design wouldn't change much, if at all if she had a race change. I know DC's backstory with her changes, but one incarnation of her has a Cuban mother. Maybe make her half-afro-latina?",DCcomics

"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [January 20, 2020]","Hey there honorary Justice League members - it‚Äôs a new week which means it‚Äôs time for a new discussion thread!

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week‚Äôs releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Green Lantern* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Green Lantern"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Anyone caught posting unwarranted top level comments will be flaired and publicly shamed.  

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Christopher Priest has been doing a great job with *Deathstork*, and I'm excited to see him write an encounter against Duck Grayson and Batmallard!""

**QUICK LINKS:**

New to DC and looking for some kind of story arc or saga that will introduce me to a lot of characters and will be easy enough to read as a first-timer.,"I *know* some DC characters, but I've really only read Batman. The last I read of him was New 52 with the Court of Owls.

My favorite thing about Marvel comics is how some events will have entire sagas that lead up to them, making it worth reading the entire thing. I'm just wondering if there is anything like that in DC that can introduce me to a good handful of characters and that leads up to any kind of crossover or large event.

For Marvel fans, I'm mostly hoping to find something similar to how [Hickman's Avengers](https://imgur.com/gallery/X9zUA8X) run worked. I know DC is different and doesn't focus on crossovers as much, but I'd like to dive into the universe as much as I can.

Batman Knightfall was really cool and (from what I remember) a bit on the lengthier side. It really felt like a journey reading it. Any suggestions are welcome. Even something totally different than I described if you really think I should read it.",DCcomics

How to read Forever Evil Event correctly?,"Hi, I was wondering how I can read properly this event. When I have been searching on internet, I found a couple of guidance but I am confused a little bit. I found a website which guides how to read. But below image makes me be confused. Isn't that enough to read Forever Evil 1-7,  Forever Evil: Rogues Rebellion,  Forever Evil: A.R.G.U.S., and  Forever Evil: Arkham War  chronologically. I mean, like in the below image, should I read other comics like  Aquaman Vol. 7 #23.1  or  Detective Comics Vol. 2 #23.1. OR These are all included in the Forever Evil complete collection that I mentioned above. Someone can brighten the issue? Thanks.",DCcomics

Question for those that can answer. I've been seeing many people say Barbara Gordon is Jim's biological daughter. When did that happen?,"The comics I read as a kid taught me she was his niece. Then when google, wikipedia, and online comics became a thing, my understanding is James was with Barbara Keane-Gordon, who had their son James Jr. Who divorced him after his affair and left to Chicago. He remarried Sarah Essen, who got killed by the Joker in a room of infants. Sarah had a niece, Barbara, who Jim and Sarah were caring for. With Sarah dead, Jim adopted Barbara as his daughter. Then of course Jim Jr returns as a crazy killer but anyways. Was all that retconned? And she's just his daughter?",DCcomics

"Have a question? Ask the veterans of DC Comics! [For the week of January 19, 2020]","Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to [hide spoilers](#spoiler) when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

Anyone Else Notice The Ridiculous Amount Of 2 Page Spreads In No Justice?,"I've been reading No Justice in preparation for Snyder's run of JL and I was reading issue #4 when I noticed that there was 11 back to back 2 page spreads. 

That's way too much for one issue! I can see having around 3 per issue, maybe even 4 but 11? Was there really a need for that many? I've looked through DKM and it didn't look like there were that many in that TPB. That makes me think that Snyder isn't the one who's making the decision to have that many (correct me if I'm wrong). 

I dont know, it might just be me who thinks that 11 is too many.",DCcomics

Integrating Wonder Woman with the New Gods?,"I've been thinking about an alternate universe version of Diana and her cast/rogues that are better integrated with Jack Kirby's New Gods.

In my opinion, having pantheons of real-life gods exist in the universe is somewhat superfluous when we have a pantheon of original gods with many analogues to real-life spheres (e.g. Orion and Kalibak represent modern ideas about war; contrast with Ares and the Greek notion of war.) This isn't anyone's fault, given that Wonder Woman was invented before the New Gods, but the New Gods have already in the past been shown to have incomprehensible forms and variants that spring up across the multiverse, united by invisible, unknowable existences beyond Earth's plane of reality.

I also don't find Wonder Woman's rogues very compelling. Greek gods are Greek gods, which means they are a) generally invulnerable in any meaningful way and b) very subject to the author's interpretation in how they operate and what their story is. The non-Greek gods are... Cheetah, Giganta, and Maxwell Lord. They don't really have a connecting thru-line to Diana's mythology.

I suggest uniting the history of the Amazons with the New Gods. One idea I had is that we revisit Kingdom Come's Avia, daughter of Mister Miracle and Big Barda. Avia is the daughter of the god of free will, and so I think she would make a perfect goddess to represent women's liberation. Women's liberation is also an aspect of 1960s-1970s American culture that Jack Kirby's original New Gods never really touched on, perhaps with the exception of Big Barda's freedom from the Female Furies.

Assume that, as New Gods do not perceive time as we do, Avia returns to the distant past to found Amazonian society. It is known that Apokolips makes use of female breeding stock; perhaps the earliest Amazons are New Gods from Apokolips freed from the breeding experiments. They might even be the Female Furies themselves.

The dimension of Paradise Island remains anchored to Earth. Amazons and their Apokoliptian technologies inspire cultures that contact them over the course of history. Some of the sillier ideas from Wonder Woman's mythos (like invisible planes and Kangas) can be played up as part of this New God origin. It's impossible (and unnecessary) to divorce the Amazons from Greek myth entirely, but the focus can be turned around on what makes Wonder Woman and her cohort foreign to known fact.

Hippolyta might be Avia's daughter. Hercules' enslavement of the Amazons could see Hercules recast as an Apokoliptian attempt at reconquest. The Hercules of Wonder Woman could actually be Glorious Godfrey in one of his many guises. Ares is Kalibak, or some avatar of Kalibak.

Maxwell Lord and Cheetah should both be interested in the technology of the New Gods. Lord already has ties to Metron and Cheetah is an archaeologist, so she could easily be integrated as messing with some gene-scrambling Apokoliptian tech. Bana-Mighdall could be Amazons corrupted by Apokolips, in need of reform with the help of Diana.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that Giganta should be a New God herself. There's references to the fact that on New Genesis and Apokolips, the New Gods are actually giants and boom tubes shrink them when they leave those planets. There's also mention of ""reaching the maximal state"" in regard to passing through the Source Wall. Giganta should be one of those New Gods attempting to reach maximal state.

Highfather stands in for Zeus, Lightray stands in for Hermes. All of the Olympians have analogues, generally.

Going forward, the New Gods and Wonder Woman's casts and villains could cross over more often with Paradise Island, New Genesis, and Apokolips interacting, conflicting, working together.

So is this worth it? Or is combining the Wonder Woman mythology with the New Gods unnecessary/too confusing? Is reimagining Diana as a New God a bad idea?",DCcomics

Catwoman 2 Variant [Cover] By Artgerm,,DCcomics
It's interesting to think that Henry Cavil's Superman and Ezra Miller's Flash have opposite problems.,"In Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, Clark's journey throughout is very serious and everything in his story is treated with a lot of weight. But a problem with the portrayal is that neither the character nor the audience are ever really given a moment to just breathe. Everything is serious. Everything is important. There's rarely if ever a moment where the weight of the world is not entirely on Clark's shoulders, especially in BvS. Not only does that get exhausting after a while but we're never allowed to get to know Clark that well outside of the situation. He never gets a chance to relax and his scenes never have any levity for the character to just be the character. He's always being smothered by what's happening.

On the other side, in Justice League the Flash's scenes were given too much levity. He was used almost entirely for comedic relief. The audience isn't able to get as invested in the situations he's in or take him that seriously because everything he's saying and doing is supposed to be funny. There's little tension and it rarely feels like what he's doing is important.

So Cavil's Superman suffered from everything with him being too serious and never allowing a break from the seriousness while Miller's Flash suffered from everything with him not being serious enough and constantly breaking away from the seriousness.

It's why I liked Superman in the climax of JL, smiling and being much brighter and confident, and why I'm hopeful for a Flash movie with Ezra because of reports that he himself is pushing for a more serious and somewhat darker script. The ratio of seriousness and levity does and should vary from character to character but you need to have both if you want the audience to be able to get invested in them.",DCcomics

Post Crisis but not Post-Crisis (80s comics),"In honor of the CW COIE, I reread the original. I've always known that it took awhile for the changes to ""stick"" but the post Crisis merged Earth and the Earth as it appears in Post-Crisis comics don't seem like the same place. 

One of the first changes that the two Supermen notice following the post Crisis merging of the Earths is that the public remembers that Supergirl died, but they don't remember how. In Post-Crisis comics, nobody has heard of Supergirl until the Matrix Supergirl debuts.

The end of the series implies that the post Crisis Superman is the Earth-1 Superman, but the Post-Crisis Superman doesn't seem to be the same guy who just no longer remembers his Pre-Crisis history.

On the merged post Crisis Earth at the end of COIE, Lana Lang and Lois Lane were both working as major national TV reporters for WGBS. In Post-Crisis Superman books, Lana is just a small town girl that nobody's heard of.

Should we just assume that one day Lana Lang came home from her WGBS job and went to be in a presumably swanky Metropolis apartment and woke up the next morning in her bedroom in Smallville?

Everyone remembers Don Hall (and, I assume, Kole), but nobody remembers the E2 Dick Grayson and Helena Wayne. Including Mary Marvel, who saw them die after the Earth merged (of course, Post-Crisis Mary Marvel really is not the same character, consider it took years for her to exist). Where did Earth-S Mary Marvel go?

Captain Atom is an entirely different guy.

Lex Luthor, who no longer remembers the Crisis because he was on OA, not at the dawn of time, is in jail when Batman, Jason Todd and Alex Luthor visit him on the post Crisis merged Earth. In Post-Crisis comics, he's never been in jail and is a successful business tycoon. Where'd his post Crisis criminal record go? 

Wolfman was careful to ensure all the duplicate characters manged to get killed off or otherwise explained away (E2 Wonder Woman in Olympus, for example), but what happened to all of the post Crisis version of the heroes present at the dawn of time that didn't appear in Post-Crisis continuity?

I know Roy Thomas used Mekanique to explain when and how the Golden Age characters' status quo changed, but was it ever addressed in any of the books at the time set during the ""present""?

Even though it seemed like Batman 408 re-introduced Jason Todd and continued on, that was really a flashback, set prior to Batman 401 (a Legends crossover, so part of Post-Crisis continuity), right?

I know from a publishing standpoint, Whatever Happened To The Man of Tomorrow and Resurrection Night were meant as swan songs for the Earth-1 Superman and Batman, but in-universe, the multiverse had existed, the Crisis did happen and the battles after the Earth merged were fought. 

Kal-El (Earth-1) did say to Kal-L (Earth-2) that it would take time to forget, which could be used to argue that the changes would be gradual. Some of the forgetting I can buy, but some of it is clearly more than just forgetting.",DCcomics

When this kid pops out she (and others) start pointing it everywhere and yelling  Mazahs! Eventually she reveals that this baby's father is Alexander Luthor.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions

&amp;#x200B;

1. When Did Superwoman and Alex get together and knock boots?

&amp;#x200B;

2. Why does this baby have Shazam lightning (or even the reverse of), Billy was granted it by the Wizard and this baby seems born with it.

&amp;#x200B;

3. How does the mother know the power word as soon as she births it?

&amp;#x200B;

4. Why doesn't the baby transform like Billy?

&amp;#x200B;

5. Can anyone hold on to Billy and say Shazam and activate his power for him? If not why can this baby's power be activated by others?",DCcomics

"[Question/Recommendation request] Trying to understand the various reboots, Crisis on Infinite Earths, New 52 etc. - would appreciate any explanations.","It's a *long* time since I've read any DC Comics graphic novels, but I'll shortly be getting some, be it from my local bookstore or library *(*I'm looking into *The Flash* - Arrowverse tie-in comics, *Supergirl*, *Stargirl*, but that's for another discussion on recommendations, so if you're recommending anything, please answer there when I've posted the discussion - it's only to avoid this getting too off-topic.*)*!

As I understand it, *Crisis on Infinite Earths* was a full-on continuity reboot, but then again the New 52 was one too, but am I wrong there?

Also, are the Earth-One series a separate continuity, or a reboot of sorts?

Is *DC Rebirth* a reboot, or a soft reboot, and as for DC YOU, was that just a rebranding of sorts?

I'm a bit confused about what's what, for story arcs etc.

I know the characters I like - The Flash, Supergirl, Batman, Superman, Green Arrow, and more recently, Stargirl, so finding a character I like isn't hard.

This is a quasi-recommendations request as I *may* start reading one of these, if I can find a copy!

Which ones do you *absolutely* recommend?

I would appreciate any explanation of the different continuities of these and major story arcs that happen, without getting too spoiler-heavy.",DCcomics
Is Szymon Kudranski the worst Superman artist in recent memory or is it just me?,"I've been catching up on my books recently and I just have to say that Action Comics went from being one of my favorite books every month to one of my absolute least favorite. Bendis's Bendising everywhere is part of that, but a majority of it is Szymon Kudranski's muddy, amorphous, and frankly ugly art.

I hated his stuff on Punisher where it at least fit the general tone of the character, but on Action it's both ugly and jarring tonally. It wasn't that long ago that we had Dan Jurgens drawing Action and now I'm looking at Szymon Kudranski's garbage. Am I overreacting? Does anyone out there like his stuff? Chime in",DCcomics

Should superman remain one exeptionnal individual supposed to guide humanity to a utopia or become symbolic mantle to give to new generations like batman?,"I was thinking about The ""5G"" and possibilty to have major characters being replaced.

And wonder what you guys think about Jon Kent replacing his father? I know Clark have been replaced before but t was either because he died or because he reached a higher plane of existence

Who would you cast in a rebooted Justice League movie?,"If the DCEU was rebooted and the Justice League would be given a new origin film, which heroes would you put in the team, which actors would you cast, and which villain should they go up against as a first team up? The cast could also consist of actors who have played the roles, and copyright problems do not matter in this scenario. Personally, I would cast:

Tom Welling as Superman

Christian Bale as Batman

Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman

Grant Gustin as The Flash (Barry Allen)

Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)

Jason Momoa as Aquaman

Stephen Amell as Green Arrow

Viggo Mortensen as Sinestro

In Young Justice, they travel to Earth 3 and the Crime Syndicate is gone, and instead replaced by the evil versions of Young Justice (Drake, Amazon etc).

On¬†Skrullos the¬†Celestials created the Prime, the Deviants and the Eternals.¬† Only the¬†Deviants are left.

On¬†Hala; later Kree-Lar did the¬†Celestials do the same?¬† And are all left?¬† Just¬†Eternals?¬† Just Prime?

Has there been any references or Easter eggs to Earth-199999 aka the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the comics?,"Like, has any of the comic universes like Earth-616 or any other earths ever make references to the MCU canonically? 

I ask that 'cause I know during the Spider-Verse story arc in the comics, Marvel couldn't use the rights to Tobey Maquire Spider-Man (**Earth-96283**) and Andrew Garfield Amazing Spider-Man (**Earth-120703**) due to both film properties being owned by Sony, BUT it was implied that both of these Spideys were part of the Spider-Army as they've been said to resemble 'the guy from *Seabiscuit*' and 'the guy from the *Social Network*', based on the films Maquire and Garfield stared in. Hell, Garfield's Spider-Man actually made a cameo appearance in Spider-Geddon #5, IIRC...

And the Japanese Spider-Man himself, Takuya Yamashiro, alongside his mech, Leopardon, hailed from **Earth-51778** to join the Spider-Army in Spider-Verse AND Spider-Geddon. And the best part is, much like Maquire and Garfield's Spider-Man, is that it's not another version of these specific Spider-Man, they're the exact same as the ones we've seen before. 

All that said as an example of how someone or something representing a property outside of the comics can actually appear in the comics in some form or fashion, what about the MCU? Has one of its characters made a brief cameo in the comics of some kind? Maybe that earth number was seen or even mentioned by someone in the comics? Anything?

If you know anything, please tell me. Thanks you in advance...",Marvel

"Comic Recommendation books like Ms. Marvel, Silk and Spider-Gwen","My teenage daughters have really been enjoying the series for Ms. Marvel, Silk, Unstoppable Wasp and Spider-gwen.  What are some similar series that they might enjoy?  They've also read the Burnside runs of Batgirl (for a non-marvel comparative).  They started a book of Squirrel Girl, but I think it was little too far out there for them.

Some I've started looking into:

* Gwenpool
* Mockingbird
* Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)
* The recent runs of X-23 (with Honey Badger)
* Steelheart

I realize those are all pretty different tonally, so I was wondering if there are any other series they should check out?  They like the series that have a mix of action and drama with some comedic moments.  And aren't as big a fan of the darker series.",Marvel

I finally saw Into The Spiderverse,"Gonna try to keep it short because everything that needs to be said about this movie has been said. I‚Äôm just giddy. Wasn‚Äôt really ever planning on watching it until I saw the whole world fall in love, when it came out. Since then, it‚Äôs been in my Netflix list to watch since it released on there, and I‚Äôve been pushing it off until tonight when I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to watch. 

Took me a bit, but after getting used to the animation style OH MY GOD I finally get why everyone was freaking out about it! All the characters were well written and fun. The storyline was easy to follow and enjoyable. Every bit, and I mean every bit, of dialogue felt like it added something to the scene. The comedy was witty and none of it felt forced. The music, oh my god the music, added soooooo much everywhere. That (spoiler I guess)  scene right before the final act where Miles jumps off the roof wearing his new suit.......jeeeeezzzz man. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I watched a movie and had butterflies recurring in every other scene. Idk man, I felt like a kid again. The ONLY thing I can think of that I don‚Äôt like is that they are *probably* not gonna make 15 more of these. Officially up there with The Dark Knight and the first Toby Spider-Man as one of my favorite superhero (and arguably overall) movies. I‚Äôm going to bed.

6/10. Decent film

Hawkeye Freefall is complete GARBAGE to actual Hawkeye fans.,"   When did it become okay to drag Clint Barton through the mud? Ever since Matt Fractions run on Hawkeye began Marvel has gone out of their way to prove that the ""formula"" of Clint being a total tool for gags works. Don't get me wrong the art style in this mini series is decent, But the writing is god awful at best. Rossenburg says he is a fan of Hawkeye but this issue proves he isn't. Jim MCcann was an actual fan of Hawkeye and showed it in the writing. Was some of Jim's dialogue cliche? In some parts yes. But he knew Clint's character and progressed him properly. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Freefall Clint is a secondary character IN HIS OWN TITLE. WTF! As well Rossenburg writes him like it is Clints first time being a hero or something. Why the fuck would he get into the limo with a known criminal / killer? 

I am a TRUE Hawkeye fan and this garbage isn't Hawkeye.

Asgard and the significance of the Nine Realms,"I understand that Asgard (as portrayed in the MCU) is one of nine planets or regions of space that are connected by a world tree. I get that these worlds are based on realms from Norse Mythology, and that the inhabitants of each world have a Norse correspondent. I understand that some places based on Norse mythology aren't necessarily Realms, but have mythological figures who interact with Asgardians and are linked with them (like Nidavellir and its inhabitants). All other planets (Titan, Hala, Xandar, etc.) exist on the same plane of existence as the Nine Realms, but are not a part of it. All of that makes sense, but the importance of these realms are still lost on me. I don't understand, for example

1. What makes the Nine Realms special? Do they operate as some sort of Nexus in the Universe that holds it together?
2. Is travel between these realms easier/faster than travel between other worlds in the Universe?
3. How did the destruction of Asgard affect the Nine Realms? Odin seemed to indicate, in *Thor: The Dark World*, that the destruction of the Bifrost in the first Thor film caused chaos for *all* of the realms. But....like why? And since Asgard doesn't exist anymore, shouldn't that cause significantly more chaos in the universe?
4. Odin also says in *Thor: Ragnarok* that ""Asgard is not a place"". Does that mean that it is the population of Asgardians that are the 'Realm' and that two realms are now on Earth, or was he being metaphorical? What does this mean when the next convergence of planets happens in five thousand years? Will one of the portals open to a fiery hole in space where Asgard used to be or will two portals open to Earth?
5. Are the realms ever going to matter again in the MCU, or has Marvel Studios pretty much abandoned that idea?

Answers from the comics would be equally helpful. I'm just struggling to understand what actually makes the Realms important. Sorry if this has been asked before...",Marvel

Do you consider Spider-verse to be classic/iconic Spider-man?,"Something that has surprised me in the last years is how much love the concept of the Spider-verse gets, including a lot of fans asking for a live action adaptation. I'm kinda confused because I always thought peak Spider-man (excluding Ditko and Romita Sr, of course) were things like his 80s stories with the Hobgoblin, Kingpin and Roxxon/Brand, while Spider-verse feels pretty bizarre to me. Now, I enjoyed the animated movie a lot and I'm not saying the comics that inspired it aren't good. But I wonder, is the Spider-verse that popular? Do you think younger fans consider these kind of stories ""iconic"" Spider-man over the old school Parker on his own ones?",Marvel

I have been watching movies my whole life, which isn't really anything special, a lot of people do - but the MCU resonated with me way more than any single movie or any series of movies, tv shows, anime etc. I'm an emotional hard ass 99% of the time, but this movie makes me cry like a little bitch every single time. Soon as I know what's about to happen in that one scene, the flood gates start coming. 

It might not be the most popular opinion in the world, or even remotely the most factual, but I think what Marvel did with this series of movies is the best thing to happen to cinema ever. Thank you for these movies Marvel.",Marvel

Endgame Question about Hawkeye's wife and the unsnappening.,"After the snap gets reversed, Hawkeye gets a call from his wife.  I am assuming it is from her cell phone as the caller id said her name and not ""house phone"".  This causes so many questions for me. 

1. When she got snapped did her phone get snapped with her?

2. Did he keep her cellphone plan active because he got a really good deal or he could not come to terms with her loss? I can imagine a deleted scene of him paying the cellphone bill every month with a tearful sigh. 

3. Wouldnt half the population suddenly coming back be worse than the initial snap? Property rights, ended marriages,  insufficient resources and lost time

4. If the phone did not snap with her, did that mean he kept it charged and ready to go?

5. Wouldnt the sim card be deactivated by the network for lack of use?

6. How did Hawkeye's wife get a call through when probably a  100 million-plus people were doing the same thing?",Marvel

Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed in X-Men Origins Wolverine,"When I think about it, what really bothers me is how good Liev was as Sabertooth, and was completely wasted in this movie. X-Men Origins Wolverine was a ridiculous movie, but one of few saving graces in that movie is Liev Schreiber's portrayal of Victor in that movie. 

He legitimately passed for Logan's half brother and was just overall a much better portrayal compared to the version of Sabertooth in the first X-Men movie, what the heck was that one about.....? Too bad Schreiber didn't get the chance to reprise, I guess with reboots and crap, it would have ruined continuity. 

Also, his attire was friggin awesome! That coat he wore was badass!

P.S... That first fight scene they had by the bar had awful editing and camera work.....",Marvel

But we now know 2 things-

1. The TWSAIS were living in a realm in which Lifebringer Galactus was not powerful enough to stay in for more than a few minutes. So they are clearly far beyond LB Galactus.

2. Loki hypothesised that they were Beyonders.

So does that mean that they are actually multiversal, if not omniversal ?

And RKT is far above even them ?",Marvel

Alternative Endgame Fight Scene,"So I honestly thought the way they used Captain Marvel in Endgame was fairly forced and a little too pushy on how Carol Danvers is a badass. So, I‚Äôm wondering what you wonderful people of reddit would think about this ending. 
Bruce banner in fact didn‚Äôt merge with hulk post-Endgame and has mostly been trying to get the jolly green giant out of hiding. Bruce wants hulk because of his anxiety of not being able to do anything when a threat comes back to earth and he isn‚Äôt able to fight. Thor is in-fact the one to being everyone back and he becomes unable to battle. Bruce goes out in the scratched up eight year old Hulk-Buster suit and as the battle goes on, the guns on thanos‚Äôs ship become aware of the growing threat and manage each Avengers kill count. Suddenly they all target the Hulk-Buster suit and the hot lasers start to burn Bruce like kernels in a bag. He lets out a roar as Hulk busts through the suit and Hulk quickly starts bashing alien skulls. The guns are still pounding Hulk with such vigour and force he looks up and leaps over eight hundred straight feet in the air bashing through alien steel like beams and reactors. Thanos looks up devastated as all guns go offline and the ship falls into the ocean. Hulk is still inside the ship as water pours into the wreckage. Banner slowly fades back in and tries to lift girders out of the way but Hulk helps with that instead taking over. Hulk tries to go over to a door and bash it open yet can‚Äôt, so Banner takes control and overrides the panel and opens it. They come to a random obstacle they both have to overcome as a team and they look like they might die as water fills the hallway to the top. We fade to black and change scenes to outside the ship on dry land where Steve is fighting with Mjolnir when he asks over the comms ‚ÄúAnyone have sight on Banner?‚Äù and then large bangs can be heard as decks are torn from their places and then the hull bursts as a strange being flies out and completely crushes a hundred feet radius of aliens before replying ‚ÄúAll good here Steve. Just had some technical difficulties.‚Äù 
Of course this is kinda just a thought I had instead of having Carol only come in at the end of the movie when she could‚Äôve been there throughout the entire thing.",Marvel

"I just re-read the Lee-Ditko Spider-Man run, with Untold Tales of Spider-Man at the same time.","The original Lee-Ditko run is one of my favorite runs on the character. It set up Spider-Man, his great supporting cast, and a wide array of some of the most iconic villains.  I‚Äôve read it many times and got the omnibus for Christmas last year.  Having not read Untold Tales before, I decided to look up the chronological order and read them at the same time.  

SPOILERS for nearly sixty year old comics.  

**My thoughts on the Ditko run**

- I love the colors of Silver Age comics- lots of red, yellow, green, and blue.  I also can‚Äôt help but love the covers, where they boast things like ‚ÄúThe most original super-hero of all time!‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Marvel Age of comics is here!‚Äù These issues have great feelings of personality that modern comics don‚Äôt have.  

- Steve Ditko is one of my favorite Spider-Man artists, and it‚Äôs really cool to see his drawing style change over the course of the title.  I like his narrow eyes for Spider-Man. 

- They made a lot of mistakes throughout the run.  Peter Palmer, Liz Hilton, Mrs. Watkins, Liz‚Äôs dad being called Mr. Brant. 

- Spider-Man does a lot of things with his webs that are pretty silly.  Giant web tarantulas...web bats (both the animal and baseball kind)....web rafts... web yo-yos...the list goes on.  The first annual in particular has a whole page about the use of all the webs.

- A lot of plot developments by and large are pretty goofy (the initial appearance of the Green Goblin, Electro‚Äôs costume, the Scorpion‚Äôs spring tail) which isn‚Äôt  helped by Stan Lee‚Äôs *very* descriptive writing.  

- A lot of plot threads repeat themselves too.  About three or so villains are Spider-Man imposters, and Flash dons a Spider-Man suit twice.  Spidey is blamed for fires numerous times.  People say the Ultimate universe is a world of a-holes, but people turn their backs on Spidey at the drop of a hat here.

- The ‚Äò60s references / slang aren‚Äôt overbearing.  The situations that make Peter and Spider-Man hated are.  

- Are these issues slightly sexist? Aunt May wants Peter to meet Mary Jane because he‚Äôll ‚Äúneed a goo

- Are these issues slightly sexist? Aunt May wants Peter to meet Mary Jane because he‚Äôll ‚Äúneed a good housewife.‚Äù  Betty has little agency of her own (which affects all the characters, actually: everyone‚Äôs always thinking about Peter or Spider-Man).  Peter thinks that all the women in his life cause him nothing but trouble.  

- I like how the villains connect to the theme of power and responsibility.  The villains are so good here.  Though, for all the iconic villains introduced, Lee and Ditko use the ‚ÄúCircus of Crime‚Äù twice, and the Enforcers three times within ten issues.  

- I like how Peter is kind of a tool and not heroic immediately.  At first he‚Äôs only concerned with making money and helping his aunt, and almost quits being Spider-Man several times.  

- Peter freaks the f out a TON when he thinks in danger of being unmasked.  Like when his mask tear fightingnre Sandman, he thinks the Sandman will know exactly who he is. Or, when he loses his powers, he‚Äôs scared someone will jump him and unmask him.  

- Aunt May is kind of annoying with how she treats Peter as a child, but she‚Äôs still an endearing character.  (I was really annoyed with her in ‚ÄúLearning to Crawl‚Äù, which I also read.  It was pretty meh).  Her illnesses in this run are actually handled well.

- Uncle Ben isn‚Äôt mentioned nearly as much as you would think.  

- Jameson is great here.  Love when Spidey swings into his office and mocks him.  

- Betty and Liz are really important here, while they‚Äôre not really around in adaptations or later runs.  Betty is kind of an irritating character (blames Peter for cheating, dates Ned), but I can‚Äôt hate her because she‚Äôs overall nice, and good to Aunt May. Though her opinion of Spider-Man is *wildly* inconsistent.  

- Frederick Foswell is such a cool character.  I like him as a reporter and stoolie that Spider-Man always mistrusts.  The resolution to his arc is not for a while after the run, but he‚Äôs an interesting supporting character and I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs been in only Spectacular- he‚Äôd have been perfect for something like the Raimi trilogy.

- The Human Torch appears a lot.  This is unpopular, but I don‚Äôt like their relationship (at least here.)

- Dr. Octopus is the main villain of the run.  He‚Äôs the ‚Äúfirst one‚Äù (debatable) to defeat Spider-Man, he‚Äôs a direct mirror to Peter / Spider-Man in several ways, he forms the Sinister Six, kidnaps Betty several times, and is the Master Planner.  However, he goes to jail several times while Green Goblin never does and keeps his identity secret.  (Norman is shown several times as a background character before he enters the plot, which is a nice touch.  Weirdly, Peter doesn‚Äôt recognize him at one point, which is funny considering other adaptations.)

- ‚ÄúIf This Be My Destiny‚Äù is still incredibly awesome and emotional.  None of the adaptions quite live up to this, which I believe is one of the best Spider-Man stories.  

- They have the letter pages in the omnibus and they are hysterical.  People thought that Vulture, Mysterio, and Foswell were all the Green Goblin.  One person wrote to beg for Spider-Man to transfer to their college.

- Favorite issues: #4, #6, #11, #12, #13, #15, #23, #24, #26, #27, #31-33

**My thoughts on Untold Tales**

- Good Art.

- I don‚Äôt mind when runs like this, or adaptations, focus on high school Peter.  The Ditko run was more about Peter at the Bugle, and Peter was always able to be the top of his class despite juggling being Spider-Man, and a villain was always active fight as the school bell rang.  In Untold Tales, Peter is late for school, for example. 

- I like the work on the supporting characters (Tiny, Jason, Sally) even though it‚Äôs always when those characters a), don‚Äôt appear in the ‚Äò60s issues, and b), don‚Äôt react to the traumatic events Untold Tales retconned in (like Sally‚Äôs death.)

- Most of the original villains are shit except Batwing, and even he is a Lizard knockoff.   Though there is one female villain which is hilarious because Peter is incredibly bashful around her.  

- They do a LOT of things like the Ditko run in annuals, such as having splash pages of villains or showing off crap like Peter‚Äôs house.  It gives it the feel of a ‚Äò60s comic.  
 
- Continuity here is off the charts! Though there are stupid explanations for things (Betty‚Äôs villain ex, Aunt May calling her friend ‚ÄúMrs. Watkins‚Äù because she was ill), there‚Äôs great continuity here: the Green Goblin‚Äôs broomstick, Aunt May freaking about Peter‚Äôs glasses, Dr. Octopus saying he‚Äôll need a better lair next time (explaining his Master Planner underwater lair.) Great attention to detail.  

- The only major break in canon is Spider-Man meeting with Dr. Strange before it happened in Ditko Annual #2.

I liked Ditko‚Äôs run better, but Untold Tales is still a fine read.",Marvel

So about the whole RDJ reprising his role as Iron Man,"What if we do the Superior Spider-Man thing but with Ironman instead.

We know someone is making a power play om the city (ant man 2) and with tony stark dead, his industries are ripe for a takeover...


Something along the lines of Dr Octopus, Dr Doon or in this twist Osborne, would try to create a clone body of RDJ's Tony Stark because some of his creations and technology was locked behind a biometric. 
So he takes over RDJ's body to pretend to be Tony Stark and he would be a Civil War level showdown and antagonist and in the end, they try to use Tony Stark's AI or stored memories from his BARF technology trials to basically try to overwrite Normand Osborne's Tony Stark with Tony's consciousness.


That way, Tony is still dead but a version of him remains and that version of him can be a conflicted version of Tony, trying to understand the concept of being dead but alive, trying to live up to his dead predecessor's legacy and even becoming some kind of anti-hero at times, in search for his own identity when all that others see are either dead tony or his Osborne persona not his NEW consciousness as its own identity.

The cool thing they can do is that they can use Peter Parker as the Catalyst that saves Tony from committing a horrible mistake, tipping him over the side of good once and for all but ONLY after Tony's already broken something in the timeline or caused a series of dominos to fall, creating the avengers' next big threat.

We would see Tony going down the path of evil or misguidance in search for himself and only find himself in the solace of his friends, family and daughter, gearing up for a war that he caused...

I would love to see such an end credit scene  and it would cause us all to flip our shits when for example, Osborne (after being critically wounded during a former battle movie with the avengers or the likes, say something along the lines of ""my body may be broken, but my mind is superior to them, superior to all... They will not see it coming, they will no see ME...coming.""


(as the screen pans into an incubator machine with frozen fog slowly desolving and revealing non other than Tony stark's body thawing in the machine... Then his eyes open as the camera zoomed in. Cut the black... 


Cut to the text on screen similar to the typical avengers will return slogan but have it say ""HE... Will return.""",Marvel

Power Balancing,"I got curious about where Scarlett Witch ranks on the marvel character ladder and I arrived at a conundrum. Once you reach the level of characters who can decide you don't exist anymore, how do you rank shit. Like, if Franklin Richards, Beyonder, One Above All, Eternity, Scarlett Witch, Jean Grey, and The Living Tribunal are all caught in a staring contest and at the same time decide the others no longer exist, then who ceases to exist? I mean I know Phoenix Force &lt; Eternity &lt; Tribunal &lt; Beyonder &lt; One Above All. However, I also know that Scarlett Witch could cause reality itself to implode. Which I guess would mean the end of Eternity is the anthropomorphization of the multiverse. Would the Tribunal then decide that didn't happen then or is reality just gone? And I don't even know where Franklin weighs in there. I'm sorry, I know I'm ignorant of many marvel happenings over the past half a decade due to happenings in my personal life. So I'm sure that I'm missing information or am wrong about some of this. It just seems paradoxical.

Edit: Getting a lot of good responses and thank you all. I just wanna be clear. I'm not asking about Wanda's standing specifically. Just trying to grasp the power difference between characters that are all capable of simply deciding that reality no longer is what it is.",Marvel
Marvel zombies resurrection to return in April mini 4 series!‚Äôn,"
Credit: Marvel Comics and newsarama

Marvel Comics has announced Marvel Zombies: Resurrection, a four-issue limited series spinning out of October's Marvel Zombies: Resurrected one-shot.

The one-shot's creative team, writer Phillip Kennedy Johnson and artist Leonard Kirk, will reunite for Resurrection, which focuses on what takes place on this Marvel Earth when some of its heroes venture into space to fight the zombie virus, as seen in the one-shot.

""I couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled to be writing Marvel Zombies: Resurrection, or to be working with the amazing Leonard Kirk again,"" says Johnson. ""The original Marvel Zombies made such an impact on fans when it came out, and now Marvel has been kind enough to let me do my own take on it,"" Kirk said in the series announcement at Marvel.com. ""And although there‚Äôs a lot there for fans of the original, it‚Äôs a very different take. Marvel Zombies: Resurrection is an all-in horror series, with tension that doesn‚Äôt let up and a cast of characters who have become like family to each other, none of whom are safe.""
 
Marvel Zombies: Resurrection #1 is due out in April. Look for Marvel Comics' full April 2020 solicitations later this month right here at Newsarama.

"Is the MCU, X-Men film series, and Spider-Man films (Tobey and Andrew) in the same multiverse?","So how I decided to ask this question is kinda crazy but I just recently watched the big Arrowverse crossover ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"".

X-Men: First Class,"I'm rewatching this movie before I watch Days of Future Past for the first time in awhile, and I don't think it's GREAT, it's certainly a good restart from the first few movies. What totally makes this movie for me is Charles and Erik. I love young and old Charles the same, but I prefer young Magneto over the older one, Fassbender just brings something different and more charming to the table, although I do think old Magneto is ok.

Thing is, what makes X-Men for me is Wolverine of course, Professor X, and Deadpool. For some reason I just don't care much for Cyclops, Beast, Mystique, yadda yadda. I'll have to see DoFP again, but I definitely think Logan, Deadpool 1 and 2, are MILES better than every movie from  X-Men 1 to The Wolverine.

I really hope Marvel Studios can make me like characters other than the faces of the X-Men, that being Professor X and Logan",Marvel

All-new x-men vol 5 bendis. Battle of atom? Scott's father?,"Hi,

I've read uncanny x-men tpbs until the 6th book, issue 600.
Now I'm reading all new x-men. I'm getting lost. Every book I pick now doesn't seem to start from the last. For instance tpb #5 starts halfway mentionning Scott missing since he left with his father. I did not see that in tpb #4, in which issue did this happen?  One tpb I saw the last issue with the mention that the next would be battle of atom~. Anybody knows why they do this? It just makes me not want to buy books just because I need to read other series at the same time to understand. Why wouldn't they put the atom part in the paperback?

Spider-Man 3's embarrassing attempt at Venom.....,"I know this about Venom in SM3 is old news, but I was just watching a video that reminded me of that disgrace in that movie, and I'm still insulted every time I see that crap.... Venom is one of my all time favorite Marvel characters, and what they did to him in this movie is just an abomination. 

Not only was Eddie horrendously cast, I think Hardy would have been a great choice  in that movie, but he couldn't have done it anyway because I think he was filming Bronson at the time. Idk who thought Eric Foreman would have nailed Eddie.... 

Now, about Venom himself in that movie, his design is disgusting! He's like average height, skinnier than friggin Thomas Haden Church as Sandman for crying out loud, had no personality to him whatsoever, nearly every time he spoke his face peels open to reveal Topher Grace, whenever he does have his face closed he doesn't even have real Venom's face.... He looks like a reptilian creature of some kind.... And he shrieks too.... My homeboy Venom does not shriek....he roars.... Different vocals, different character. 

The movie Venom was not a good movie by any stretch, but at least they got the character himself right regardless of the origin. 

Side note, that Barakapool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine is even worse.... They even sewed the mouth of the Merc....with the.....Mouth....shut....

What is it with movie studios or producers making Marvel and DC characters look like absolute morons? Juggernaut wasn't even done right until Deadpool 2.... What was that in X-Men 3....? üòÇ

I know this is old news, but I just wanted to voice my thoughts here

Alternative Endgame Ending,"Okay, so. Just imagine if instead of Steve going back in time to live his life with Peggy, he instead does this. After putting all the stones back he goes to 1947 and has everything from the twelve years he‚Äôs been in the future. He has a pair of drumsticks from Hawkeye (AOU Party), Asgaurdian flower from Thor, The steering wheel from Sam‚Äôs car (TWS) From Sam, A Queens postcard from Peter and so on. He has them all in a duffle bag and looks at them from the alleyway across from Peggy‚Äôs house. He sees her car in the driveway but it seems like either she‚Äôs sleeping or nobody‚Äôs home. He gets up and is about to dart across the street when a car pulls down the street and pulls into Peggy‚Äôs driveway and a man with a single crutch gets out of the driver side and helps what seems to be a hazy Peggy out of the passenger side. He opens the door after finding the key under the doormat and walks in and turns on the dining room light. Not even ten minutes pass by when he turns off the lights and exits, following by him hopping in his car, accidentally forgetting to close the door. Steve then darts across the road with his shield and duffel bag to Peggy‚Äôs driveway where he walks down her stone pathway and up to her porch. He slowly opens the door and takes his shoes off at the door and leaves his duffle bag as well. He walks around and is jittering with excitement at seeing Peggy for the first time in twelve years, he goes into her room and has almost completely forgotten about the man and he is about to wake Peggy when he notices a note glowing from the moonlight on her nightstand. He looks at it yet doesn‚Äôt touch. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt freak out Peg, I just drove you home and you in fact didn‚Äôt get in a bar fight! Congrats. Next time, let‚Äôs not go to get drinks at that bar. -Sousa‚Äù Steve feels an immense pain in his chest and slowly backs off from her bed as she rolls over and slightly squints. Her eyes haven‚Äôt adjusted to the darkness and he slowly shuts the door to not make a sound. He hears from outside the door her bed creak as she rolls back over. He sighs and has a few tears dripping down his cheeks. He looks around and can see some pictures in frames of her and Edwin Jarvis, Howard Stark and who clearly looks like co-workers or the man on the crutches. Steve slips on his shoes and picks up his duffle bag. But before leaving, he writes a note and dates it as 5/18/45 just so she doesn‚Äôt get freaked out if she ever finds it. Steve writes ‚ÄúPeggy, before we go on this mission to finish off RedSkull. I hope you know, I do have feelings for you. Peggy Carter, I love you, and always will. -Steven Rogers‚Äù he puts it in an envelope and hides it under her large wooden cabinet. Steve then exits and looks back on the house as he goes into the alley and puts on the time travel suit thing and goes back to 2023.

Bucky: So, Steve, how was it?
Steve: A little bumpy but I did it. Everything. Nothing is not where it should be. Either way, with Thanos gone once more. I can possibly start my life over and have a normal year for the first time since 1943. Hopefully... I can move on.
Bucky:... Wow, when did you become a philosopher.",Marvel

Where do people go to get comics graded?,"I've seen several posts on comic subs about people sending their comics off somewhere to get an official grade. Where/who is this Company? How much does this cost? I have the first issue that Spider-gwen ever appeared in, and am interested in getting it graded. I see they're worth several hundred dollars online. I actually have no intention to sell it, but its cool to have an idea of how valuable it is. I'm also concerned about mailing it off, because the local USPS/Fedex/UPS in my city do not give a shit about your stuff, and will just stuff/fold things in our mail slot. I've ordered several trades that were damaged due to how the delivery person stuffed it in our mail slot. I do not want this to happen to this comic...",Marvel

I have a question about the end of Avengers Endgame.,So at the end of the movie you see Captain America travel back in time to put back all the infinity stone and mjolnir. But he didn't come back from his time travel and instead stay in that timeline and got old. My question how did captain america stay in the timeline where he travel if he know there going to be another steve roger in that timeline? And why didn't the marvel time travel rule didnt apply to captain america?,Marvel

Extention of the bond between Spider-Man and Wolverine/ Tragedy of Exiles's Mariko Yashida and MJ Watson.,"You know what I find to be interesting? In Marvel's multiverse, there are versions of Spider-Man and Wolverine's biggest love interests Mary Jane Watson and Mariko Yashida who both fell in love with each other. And not only that, they were both superheroes pattered off of someone close to them. MJ called herself Spider-Woman, a gender swapped moniker to Spider-Man. And Mariko called herself Sunfire, the identity her cousin Shiro took when he joined the X-Men with Wolverine in Giant-Sized X-Men. Spider-Man and Wolverine's bond is pretty special. In one of their shared comic book series, they travelled across time and space together for years and became incredibly close. Spider-Man brought Wolverine back to life with a Cosmic Cube after Wolverine died shooting a planet sized Doctor Doom dead with a Phoenix Bullet. And after jumping to the Wild West, they became blood brothers. Inspired by that one John Wayne western, I suppose, but it was after all that when Wolverine trusted Spider-Man entirely. And Wolverine doesn't trust a lot of people. And I find it so interesting how their bond could even reach across multiple realities where even their true loves became entangled by them.

Unfortunately, these versions of Mariko and MJ were split up by the fabric of two realities. And when they met, it was when Mariko and her team known as the Exiles arrived on a world plagued by Vi-Locks. Techno-organic zombies created by the merging of an inorganic alien and a virus that once only affected mutants, but eventually spread to humans as well. While the Exiles helped that world's Avengers, humanity's last stand, Mariko met with and began hanging around with Avenger Spider-Woman: Mary Jane Watson. Eventually, a spark grew between the two women, but duty forced the Exiles to one mission on another Earth, and another, until a vampire warlock cast one final spell as he burnt to ashes to disrupt the Exiles' next trip. Mariko and her teammate Nocturne were pulled back to Vi-Lock world, and Mary Jane was reunited with her lover.

It was a complicated and tragic relationship between these two women connected by cosmic circumstance to two great heroes, but it was enduring and beautiful to the unfortunate end. 

While Mariko and MJ spent time together for over a month, Nocturne pointed out that at any time they could've been pulled out of that reality to their next mission, and any hope of a future for a relationship with MJ could very well have been lost. So Nocturne suggested that they ended things before they got hurt. MJ overhead, and agreed with Nocturne, but Mariko persisted. Even if they had the chance to grow old together, one would have been pulled away from the other anyway. And so, for all the time they had left together, the two women spent it together until Mariko and Nocturne were pulled away. And what's even more tragic is on the Exiles' next mission, that was when Mariko was inadvertently killed by Mimic, one of her teammates who was possessed by a parasitic alien Brood queen. She was buried on MJ's world, though she preferred that she were buried on her world so her parents could visit her. Even if they didn't agree with her sexuality. And years later, MJ was abruptly killed and devoured by a world traveling life sucking vampire Inheritor known as Morlun. 

My heart broke for these characters. And as unique versions of already known characters, I wish they had a better deal in their stories, but that's usually what happens in storytelling. Tragedy often makes viewers want to continue on to see how things will go in the absence of certain characters. And sometimes the stories persist. Exiles went on until about the late 2000s, and was recently rebooted with new characters. But unfortunately for MJ, she was killed off as a consequence of obscurity. That, and the unfortunate trope of fictional LGBT characters getting killed. Particularly lesbians. And Mariko was also a victim to this trope. I hoped for something better for MJ afterwards, maybe even a new relationship with someone new, or even checkup of how she was doing on her world. Or maybe even a glimpse into some multiversal afterlife where the two women are reunited. But that wasn't the case. While I am glad that LGBT characters are being given a better deal in fiction, writers and directors still have ways to go.",Marvel

GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY #1 Trailer | Marvel Comics,,Marvel
Silly questions about Morbius depiction in comics,"With the new Morbius movie coming out in july I have been looking into the character all I knew was the 90s animated spiderman version. Something I have been confused on is in when he is human he doesnt appear to have facial hair then when he turns into a vampire all the sudden he gets what appears to be a soul patch or some other chin only facial hair style (some versions anyway) so is that facial hair or is it supposed to be something else? I am aware it is all up to the artist but I am trying to figure out what the artist has drawn. If it is facial hair what is the actual name of that style?

Comic Book recommendations on Kang the Conqueror,"From the theories I read and from my wonderful experience with the show Earth's Mightiest Heroes it leads me to conclude that Kang the Conqueror is most likely the next big baddy to succeed Thanos in the MCU.

Now that time travel is an actual thing in the MCU, not just any kind but multi-timeline travel, I believe there is no better villain to take the spot light then a super genius monarch who seeks to conquer all of time. The premise can even fit with Earth's Mightiest Heroes plot, the Avengers's meddling with time to save their friends could have caused Kang's future timeline where he rules ALL to slowly fade from existence.

This might not turn out to be the case, the next big baddy might just be Galactus but either way I do wish to explore more lore about one of the Avengers greatest foes. So can you recommend any story that explores Kang the Conqueror so I can learn all about this sci-fi Alexander the Great?",Marvel

Why are the Asian characters on Iron Fist mostly mixed race Asians?,"Nothing wrong with mixed Asian actors, but when that's the majority...Maybe not intentionally but subconscious bias.

What are the chances that out of all the Asians actors available, that of the ones they cast nearly all are mixed?

Edit: Let's not even consider out of the world, let's just consider California. Out of 39.5 million Californians, an estimated 110,000 are actors (Using this estimate for union actors across the US, because estimates including aspiring actors should be higher, but there's no record for aspiring actors)

That's 0.2% of Californian actors or aspiring actors.

Let's say 0.2% of the 4.9 million Asian Californians  (12% of Californians) are actors or aspiring actors. That's 9800 available actors of Asian descent in California.

But someone commented that perhaps most actors of Asian descent tend to be mixed. 
A 2018 census states 5.1% of Californians are from 2 or more ethnicities. So no idea which of these are mixed Asian and white. 

Let's say of the 5.1% of mixed Californians, 12% are mixed Asian Californians. Of that, 0.2% are actors or aspiring actors. That's 484 mixed Asian actors out of 9800 available actors of Asian descent (4.9%).

What are the chances that there was no bias favoring mixed Asian-Caucasian or mixed Asian-Caucasian looking actors when casting for Asian roles?",Marvel

Comic book recommendations for Iron man and Hulk,"I've fallen in love with the MCU like everyone else in my generation and my favorite characters are Ironman and Hulk.

My only knowledge of these characters and the marvel universe is histories I read on wikipedia, some YouTube clips and ofcourse the animated cartoons like 1998 Ironman &amp;  1996 Incredible Hulk(&amp; She-Hulk) and Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

I would love to read more stories with these amazingly smart and amazingly strong superheroes.

What comic books can you recommend to me that are:

1. High quality writing and story telling that stays true to the superheroes established character traits.
2. Don't require up-to-date knowledge of the Marvel universe and other characters to understand the plot.
3. Have modern beautiful artwork. I don't want to seem shallow but I really don't think I have the patience looking into older comic books with bright colors and old art styles.

Would also appreciate if you can recommend the websites from which I can read or download the comic books.",Marvel

Filling In The Gaps: Marvel's Best Decision,"I personally love how Marvel's gone back and filled in the (now) decades-long gap between the end of World War 2 and the emergence of the Fantastic Four, and even establishing the emergence of superheroes and supervillains as World War 1 rather than World War 2.

From Freedom's Five in World War 1, to the Confederates of the Curious and the Mystery Men in the 1930's, Department Zero (Agents of Atlas), the Avengers Initiative, the Monster Hunters and the First Line all active through the 50's and 60's (with the First Line also being active in the 70's, 80's and 90's), and now the J-Team, J-Squad and Justice For All being active in the 70's, 80's, 90's and early 2000's, basically every decade from 1910 to 2020 has had superheroes and supervillains in the traditional sense running around the Marvel Universe.

And that's not counting singular heroes like Sentry and Blue Marvel. Personally, I hope Marvel keeps going back and filling in those gaps because it never really did make much sense to me that from the end of WW2 all the way to the Fantastic Four's appearance there would be radio silence in the superhuman community.",Marvel

[QUESTION] Why did Thanos not snap away every Avenger in Infinity War?,"In IW, Thanos snaps away half the population in the universe which gets rid of some but not all of the Avengers. I was wondering why he didn‚Äôt just specifically choose to snap away all of them and then let the power of the snap do the rest of the work; I thought he‚Äôs allowed to choose who he can snap away.

Alternative Origin or Story to Black Widow? Soviet/Russian parallel to Captain America?,"I‚Äôm not going to lie I feel like new Black Widow movie could be much more depth and cooler then how it is currently.

Why not make Black Widow somewhat like Soviet/Russian parallel to captain America? She super soldier too and in comics was originally Soviet spy. 

You could even freeze her like they did Captain America and Winter Soldier to get rid of time gap issues and to conflict with comics less while at same time conflicting less with movie universe too. Basically a hint more to her comic or Soviet origins. The time freeze also makes it where you can more easily put cannon together without characters aging a lot. Black Widow also does age slower due to her super soldier serum so that helps.

So for Black Widow origins I thought it be interesting if they had it be in World War 2 like Captain America but on Eastern Front as Soviets are being invaded by Nazis. The battle of Leningrad being possible starting point. Soviets did have more female partisans and even soldiers because this was a do or die war for them. The Nazis did intend on wiping them out so women and even kids took up weapons because this was a war and a genocidal war at that. So it makes sense why female there and fighting without being unrealistic/unhistorical or forced. It fits story and background. 

Unlike more idealistic depiction of Captain America and more ‚Äúhurrah‚Äù Americans fighting nazis you get a look at more harsh side of war. Eastern Front especially in Soviet Union saw some of worse of Nazism war crimes and horrors. This could be explanation to Black Widow more cold or pragmatic attitudes. Eastern Front and Soviet/Russian background being upbringing that would create a mindset like this. 

Black Widow could be Soviet Sniper and partisan in Leningrad fighting behind Nazis lines as they advance. To add more flavor and as nod at Stan Lee own background and nod at multi ethnic of Soviet Union you make Black Widow half Jewish and half Russian. Not a huge point especially after origin story just other reason for her to fight Nazis and be against them. Also gives easy reason to have her family killed off during invasion of Leningrad by Nazis firing squad. Which only motivates and hardened her more especially in her fight against Nazis/Hydra. 

During battle of Leningrad she almost dies fighting Nazis/Hydra but helps turn tide of battle somehow and gets taken to Soviet lab in Urals to be relived and injected with super soldier serum after impressing a Soviet scientist who was trying to escape Leningrad during invasion and bring her along while escaping siege. 

Super soldier serum is basically super steroids and drug performance enhancers no way you put it. Given this is Soviet Union and Russians you should figure out how rest easily writes itself. You could add in some jokes here about this into movie. 

Unlike Captain America the Soviets being in extremely desperate situation and being Soviets do the procedure to make Black Widow a super soldier with safety thrown to wind and have less refinement. Think more when Wolverine is given his metal injections. She is also still seriously injured and near death from fighting and escaping Leningrad. Body in full shock and cardiac arrest. Blood shot eyes and screaming but makes it through. Soviet Serum almost killing her but bringing her back to life near end. 

From here is where she officially becomes black widow. She made official part of Soviet military and intelligence. She sent to Moscow to fight immediately after where she can meet people like Stalin and be part of battle there. 

Like Captain America she becomes a propaganda symbol but for Soviet Union. You can have all Soviet and communist imagery and music in film. Black Widow name brings code name and nickname given because she kills Nazis soldiers and officers. Making many widows and black color often ties to fascist. Basically she kills fascist. Sniping them often times. 

Additionally, you want to avoid dehumanizing or stereotyping Soviets/Russians too much. Like US they are fighting same enemy Nazis/Hydra so they should not depict Soviets as influenced by Hydra until after war. Both US and USSR took in Nazis scientist in real life and always thought Hydra infiltration of US/Shield is nod to that. Soviets could have similar issue after war but during war they fight them like US or Shield would. The Soviets basically have their own versions of that and you make a few small references in movie about how they won‚Äôt work with US/shield/capitalist organizations because they don‚Äôt trust them and have their own to deal with stuff like hydra. You actually see fight against hydra from someone besides US/shield and who have different ideas about how to deal with them(much more brutal then US or shield).

Furthermore, I think it be interesting to make her actually believe in Soviet Union and communism at least until the collapse of USSR. Captain America in comics often represent more idealistic and positive elements of American patriotism. Black Widow could represent Soviet patriotism or loyalty for its good and bad. More pragmatic and pessimistic in mindset those. A ‚Äúends justifies the means‚Äù mentality which fits USSR in this circumstances. Stalin might suck by Nazis did intend to wipe out 90 percent of USSR population and enslaved rest. They literally had no future if they lost. This naturally creates people who will do whatever is necessary to survive and win. The horrors of conflict only numbing them more of remorse. Black Widow character seems like she should fit that outlook. 

During movie she could see horrors of Eastern front while also being high action(keeps people entertained is still important). Black Widow liberates the concentration camps and discovering mass graves. She can also be part in some of mass retaliations and execution of captured soldiers or even direct and order them but to make her still show hints of kindness or morals you have her stop or even shoot Soviet soldiers for their infamous war crimes against German women while marching west. 

Black Widow final fight could be at Battle of Berlin against Hydra commander who basically a parallel to Himmler and most fanatical Nazis. Black Widow has to fight an even more extreme Nazis/Hydra fanatics then Captain America. 

After the war those and unlike winter soldier she voluntarily freezes herself and gets unfroze multiple points during Cold War where she fights for and helps Soviet Union even if it‚Äôs against Shield or US. She doesn‚Äôt join them until 90s and 2000s after USSR is gone. Maybe have her even temporarily be criminal/Russian mobster/hired gun in 90s after USSR collapse before Shield recruits her. 

This would make her relationship with Captain America more interesting especially if she knows what happened to Bucky from start and withheld that information from Captain America until later. 

At end of her origin story you can even have Captain America cameo at end where two meet during aftermath of war. Like both sides lines meeting or peace talks after. 

To highlight Black Widow powers more the origin movie could to slow motion scenes while she sniping or fighting showing how her reflexes and perception are super human level. She can see bullets coming at her and can see much further range wise. She also has very high levels of pain endurance and never fatigue really. They really don‚Äôt highlight her super soldier abilities enough.

During origin story it also be interesting if during war and when she first gets serum she is more jacked and muscular like Captain America. You find out she only cut down on size because she needed to blend in while spying in west and against Soviet enemies during Cold War. Maybe make joke how a woman that looks like she can handle most guys would immediately stick up in 50s America and be bad spy. 

Also Scarlet Johansson is great actor and I‚Äôm curious if she could get jacked like guy actors do for some roles. A female super soldier is going be more muscular too. I find it funny Hollywood hasn‚Äôt figured out women have to be muscular or jacked too if they are playing action roles and not just look like a model. Fighting women characters can be hot too but they need to look like what you would consider a warrior/super soldier/or whatever. I think Hollywood thinks it can make any hot woman look like a fighter with aerobatics and stunts alone. You can actually look at person and usually get a good feel for how tough or strong they are. I just find it odd with men superheroes they expect dude to hit gym and put on muscle size while with women they just ok with looks, acting skill, and just if they are athletic but don‚Äôt encourage them to put on muscle size to sell role better",Marvel
Fantastic 4 Casting,"This is no way confirmed, it is entirely my own decisions, but this is the cast that I would LOVE to see.

Reed Richards: John Krasinski

Susan Storm: Emily Blunt

Johnny Storm: Taron Egerton

Ben Grimm: Chad L Coleman

As I stated before, this is just who I personally would love to see bring the Fantastic 4 to the MCU. I think they all fit perfectly.

John Krasinski has lately been stretching his acting skills since the office with shows like Jack Ryan and A Quiet Place, both showing he knows how to act smart and sophisticated and still have a fair amount of action thrown in with a wide range of emotion. 

Emily Blunt, John Krasinski's real life wife, would do perfectly as Susan Storm not just because she's actually married to the man I want to play Reed Richards, but because her acting range is very flexible and she has shown that she can handle action movies and fill the very mother-like role that Susan Storm takes in the team.

Taron Egerton as Johnny Storm would just be too perfect. He totally floats the arrogant, cocky, playboy vibes with his roles in Kingsman, Rocketman, and Robin Hood. His acting is incredible with tons of range and nobody rings truer to Johnny than he does for me.

Chad L Coleman would make a perfect Ben Grimm in my eyes since his role in the Walking Dead was that of a man larger than life with enormous strength, yet a kind and caring heart just screams the Thing. He pulls off that type of role really well and I would choose him before anyone else to be Ben Grimm.",Marvel

How would the Primordials from God of War fit into the Comics?,"here are their powers and abilities.

Little detail is available about their history as well as the full extent of their powers in the series currently. Given the nature of their battles though, we can assume and speculate that the Primordials all possessed the following abilities:

* **Immortality** \- The Primordials had the potential to live forever and could only be destroyed by beings of equal or greater power. They are personifications of the eternity of nature and the universe.
* **Invulnerability**¬†\- The Primordials were impervious to mortal harm and could only be harmed by one another or beings of greater power. They are beings of pure elements and cosmic, not bound by the weaknesses of flesh, blood, bone, energy, and soul.
* **Vast Divine Powers -** as the creators of the world and the entire universe, the Primordials possessed astronomical cosmic and elemental powers. Given the fact that they predate the [Sisters of Fate](https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/Sisters_of_Fate), not even Fate itself holds sway over the Primordials. They are also older, than [The Furies](https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/The_Furies), though it is unknown if the Furies could be of any challenge to the Primordials (Though considering how Kratos, a mortal demigod, was able to single-handedly kill all three of the Furies, it is highly probable that the furies would be no match at all for the Primordials).
* **Absolute Strength** \- Their size and mass contribute to their astronomical superhuman strength and durability, making them more likely to be superior to Titans, Olympians, and any other¬†creature less than a Primordial. This makes them possibly the strongest beings in the *God of War* (Greek) universe.
* **Unlimited Stamina** \- The Primordials are not subject to fatigue. They could wage war for centuries without rest or relent.
* **Near-infinite Durability** \- The Primordials are beings of pure elemental and cosmic forces. They are flawlessly indestructible and are capable of withstanding powerful blows and colossal amounts of pain for billions of years without showing any signs of exhaustion.",Marvel

Why is Marvel good while the DC are garbage?,"I just realized that I pretend Marvel than DC because since I was kid I'm engaged in the Marvel universe, good games (xmen snes, snes spider man, snes avengers, ps2 alliance, ps2 xmen, marvel vs capcom etc), good comics (fantastic four, spider man etc ).

Movies like Spider Man 2002 is one of my favorites while Batman Begins and Superman The Return to me was very boring to watch, to be honest watching a Batman movie sometimes I just don't know if I'm watching a super heroe movie or Titanic or another trash, there is a lack of action, sound and visual effects, etc. In Marvel movies since the first Spider Man I felt immersed in the action everytime with a good story and a good action that is what we deserve, while Batman has a bad story and a bad action (without mention the dark filter that makes you see nothing).

Batman isn't a superhero, he is just a kind of cop, while Superman is a embarassing guy dressing thong who probably attend the church and follow all the rules, Wolverine is a ""badboy"" and Spider Man a tricky guy who knows the streets how to take advantage. 

The only exceptions was the Joker of Heath Ledge and the new Joker just because it is the joker, Batman vs Superman at least has good effects but a shitty plot execution, this movie and all the DC universe (except the two joker movies) should be casted in the trash.

While I can't remeber a bad Marvel movie, even the X-Men ones that isn't ""that great"" however it is far to be trash like the DC movies.",Marvel

Finished Morrison's New X-Men(2001) run and I'm a little overwhelmed by all the X-Men books.,"So, after reading the most important marvel series from Avengers Disassembled all the way to Fear Itself, I decided to finally dive into modern X-men comics starting with Morrison's New X-Men up until House of M and Decimation.

However after finishing Morrison's series I'm a little overwhelmed by all the titles.

I figured that after Morrison's run ended, New X-Men went to have a focus on the new members on the academy, the new generation and, Astonishing X-Men kept the focus on the old team so I started reading both series and thought that was it but I just found out that there are many other titles that ran parallel to them.

Specifically X-Men, Uncanny X-Men, District X and Excalibur. So I'd like to ask some X-Men experts around here to explain to me what is the focus in those books and if they're good reads or if they have key plot points for House of M and decimation.",Marvel

I try to fight one that comes close but it's strength rivals my own and my punches don't even faze it. I decide that combat isn't an option at the moment and chose to flee before I quickly get overwhelmed.

While my foot speed is faster than the Zombies by a noticable margin, and (thanks to being in a dream) I have virtually unlimited stamina, there's still an enormous amount of them and their numbers are growing by the second. As I run down halls, more keep appearing in front or around me, who attempt to punch, grab and bite me, luckily my armor, while not invincible, is resistant to attacks, and when I'm finally surrounded, I jump into the air, and launch a kinetic blast to the ground...only to find that not a single zombie was killed, or even injured, from the attack. Just as they finished getting up, I was already down a different hall. As I looked around, I noticed that each hall or room I was in was huge, each being the size of about a highschool (if it was all empty space, with no rooms or floors). 

Time and time again I was surrounded, grabbed and attacked, and time and time again was I forced to use my Kinetic Blast to escape, with direct hits killing some Zombies, but only if they were punches to the face. Soldiers who I ran passed, I saw fighting and/or shooting the Zombies as best as they could, however, no one stood a chance. Eventually, I got to an exit, only for it to also be overrun with hundreds of Zombies, as I looked around in wonder if how to get around them, I heard footsteps of the restless undead approach. Then I woke up.",Marvel

TIL Ike Perlmutter was so awful to Marvel,"Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, a friend of Ike, discloses how Ike strongly opposed a Black panther or Female character movies. He also opposed Kevin Feige's ideas, supports Trump (I mean millions in donations) and was awful to the writers. For More info, read Bob Iger's book which praises Ike but discloses it, or ask Kevin on Twitter or any writers who interacted with Ike. It is sad how he still profits massively from the movies made. Is it possible for us, the public, to oust him?",Marvel

Want to get back into reading X-Men,"I've been on the fringes of the reboot of the X-Men line under Hickman. Should I wait for a collected edition or buy the individual editions? I'm intrigued at the world building aspect and the new teams and revamped characters.

Is there a good reading order I should follow to catch up? Anything prior to the Hickman reboot that I should look at pertaining to the X-Men or can I pick it up starting from Hickman's new run?

I'm not new to comics but haven't been reading for many years. I mostly follow the stories that ComicsExplained on YouTube talks about so I'm aware on the fringe only.

I finally got around to watching Venom (Spoiler free),"I took forever to watch this movie mostly because of the reviews but also partly because it wasn't connected to the MCU. Now, with the announcement and trailer for Morbius it seems that Sony wants to become more tangled into the MCU (which is awesome!!!) so I figured I'd watch Venom so I'd be all caught up. Now That I've watched it I have to wonder, how did this movie get so badly shit upon by reviewers? It was great and so much funnier than I thought it would have been. Was it just because Tom Holland's Spider-Man didn't shown up in the movie? It certainly deserved more praise than it got.",Marvel

Longer stories?,"Greetings, heroes! 

I recently decided to try to get into reading comic books, and I've done my fair share of googling, youtubing and what-have-you to try and find tips and tricks on how to pick a starting point and they're all very good ideas of where to start. I subscribed to Marvel Unlimited and read a bit there.  


I do have one question though, seeing as how I am, again, very new to comic books - are there any stories with.. uhm.. some sort of continuity? I mean, where comic book #1 leads to comic book #2 and etc? so far I've tried reading a bit of deadpool, some moon knight and a bit of spider-man and from what I've gathered every comic book is more or less standalone in the sense that the various characters fights a new enemy in every new book and the previous release doesn't really matter all that much.  


I was hoping for a long, interesting story - is that maybe not really a thing in comic books or have I just not found the right one?  


Sorry if this question gets asked all the time, I tried googling this as well but it's sort of hard to search for this particular question haha.",Marvel

Haven't properly picked and read a comic book in about 3 years. What's a good book/s to jump back into the Marvel Universe with?,"The last last ""BIG"" event I remember reading was Secret Empire. Cheers!",Marvel
Which Marvel Characters should I read comics about if I only had to choose 3?,"so I am currenlty reading old Spidey I am waiting for Epic Collection 5.

"I don't believe that Morbius is taking place at all in the MCU. I'm pretty sure Sony is just working everybody with their trailer, no different than the technique of focusing heavily on a dream sequence.","I would ABSOLUTELY put money on Keaton playing an entirely unrelated character based on what actually appears to be happening in his scene in the trailer. Even the brief glimpse of him in this trailer doesn't make sense for his character is in the MCU. Why would Vulture be somewhere that appears to be surrounded by police cars, taunting Morbius during what feels like an arrest?

My bet is that Sony CLAIMS eventually that his cameo is an homage to him being the original (non-Adam West) movie Batman actor since Morbius is a bat-based superhero character, while knowing full well that what they're actually doing is trying to trick people into seeing the movie thinking it's in the MCU. It feels no different to me than building a trailer around a brief dream sequence (Rise of Skywalker/Batman v Superman etc) in order to get people into the theater based on assuming that the most interesting thing in it actually has anything to do with the plot of the film, instead of just being a scene that could easily be cut without affecting the rest of the movie.

Same goes for the Spider-man graffiti. While the idea of this movie taking place in the Sam Raimi Spider-man universe with a 40 year old Tobey Maguire being brought eventually as a grizzled Spiderman might be something they're able to work out with Marvel eventually and would be a unique way of making these Sony Spiderverse movies work, lll bet that graffiti is the absolute only time that Spiderman shows up in this film and they just put that shot in the trailer because they have the rights to the PS4 Spiderman, which is where that particular image actually came from and can use it to make you think he'll have a bigger role. 

This is either something that Sony will speak on within the week after enough people have heard that this movie is in the MCU that they know that saying it's not won't reach as many ears, leaving many people to still think it is, or it won't be revealed until the movie comes out and it gets a ton of backlash for its misleading campaign AFTER it makes money on the opening weekend.",Marvel
It‚Äôs Been A Long Long Time Song,I was just rewatching Winter Soldier and I noticed at 34:50 the song It‚Äôs Been A Long Long Time plays as Steve walks in on Fury sitting in his apartment.

She started collecting comics when she was 3, which was when she got into superheroes. Her parents used to buy her the comics. Anyway, she had a lot of stuff like the entirety of Crisis on Infinite Earths (DC), The New Teen Titans (DC), Captain America and The Falcon, and this one arc I liked a lot which I believe was from an Avengers run.

It had to be around the early 80s. Rhodey (who'd later become War Machine) was suffering headaches for some reason. This was after Tony gave him his Iron Man armor, I don't remember why but I just knew Rhodey had headaches. This went on for a couple of issues until it was revealed the headaches were because of something related to issues he was going through... 

I'd like to see which arc this was. If it helps, I read it around late 95 or definitely 96.",Marvel
What is your favorite storyline and why?,"Personally the first Civil War is my favorite. We‚Äôve always seen ‚Äòhero versus hero‚Äô but never like this. From the explosive beginning with the Stamford Incident to the way Peter Parker realizes he chose the wrong side, to Frank Castle being Frank no matter the circumstances, this story involves so many and does it so incredibly well. 

It was also a lasting event. Things did not go back to the status quo for quite some time after that it seemed to generate a lot of new interest in some really random side characters.",Marvel

"Should the Radioactive spider that bit Peter Parker, should it return and become a proper character?","In most universes, this spider either immediately dies after giving the famous bite or unceremoniously disappears without being acknowledged.  For a creature that plays the massive role of creating Spiderman, I think more should be done with it. What do you think? Should it return, and if so, in what form, as a supervillain, hero or something else?",Marvel

Who's the Character?,"Hello everyone, my brother and I are kind of stumped. There was a character in older marvel comics who was a kid raised by a cult to be very powerful.

(I know dumb questions, but my brother and I have these healthy debates and we're both stumped so I thought I'd ask.)",Marvel

Help with X-men,"So I'm kinda new to comics (not that new to Marvel in general tho) and recently I turned my attention to X-men. Then the ammount of comics blew me away (I buy them online). Like when I bought She-Hulk comics I just got them all because she had like 5 modern series. But now I could use some guidance if I don't want to go bankrupt. I've read the wiki faq and searched for some former recommendation posts, but that was still a lot of comics with little or no reason given why they are recommended.

**I'm mostly interested in modern comics (don't really like those old arts), like 2000+. My favourite X-men are Kitty, Logan, and Jean. Would be nice if all - but at the very least one - of them would be a main character.**

**So far I have these comics:**

* All-New X-men
* Avengers &amp; X-men: Axis
* Avengers vs X-men
* Black Vortex
* House of X/Powers of X
* Phoenix Resurrection: The Return Of Jean Grey
* X-men (2013-15, the female lineup)
* X-men Blue/Gold/Red/Black

I've also put the following on my wish list with varying degree of thought put behind the decision (ranging from ""I like the cover"" to ""frequently recommended on reddit""). **Feedback on these would be awesome:**

* All-New Wolverine
* Astonishing X-men by Joss Whedon
* House of M
* Hunt For Wolverine: Mystery In Madripoor
* Inhumans vs X-men
* Uncanny X-Men: X-Men Disassembled (2018)
* War of The Realms: Uncanny X-Men
* Wolverine and the X-Men By Jason Aaron
* X-men: Hellbound
* X-men: Kitty Pryde - Shadow &amp; Flame
* X-men: Phoenix Endsong

**I also plan to get the new Dawn of X comics when there are collections. So aside from those any further recommendations?** Also **i**f you could mention the main characters and why you recommend it briefly (like great story/art/dialog and characters/essential for status quo/etc) I'd appreciate it.

Thanks in advance.

Which Marvel app is better for Star Wars comics?,"I downloaded two Marvel Comic book apps to my tablet and can't decide which is better.

My 8-year old son is big into Marvel right now, and he's exhausted my old, small collection of kid-friendly Marvel comic books.  I'd like to sign him up for a monthly subscription in the mail, but when I go to the Marvel subscriptions page, and click on ""kids"", it returns no results.  Really?  Are they offering no kid-appropriate titles by mail?

If not, are there any other options for making this happen?  Any third party companies that can be a ""go-between"" on mailing out the issues to some appropriate title?

But if you are patient, they'll eventually come back down to about $30 a book.  Does Marvel keep some or all of their trades in print?  Is there any way I can see if they plan on releasing another run of this Superior Spider-man collection?  It came out about a year ago, and is already near a hundred dollars on the after market, so it seems like there'd be enough demand for them to reprint it.",Marvel

I sympathise with Hank Pym fans here's why,"Okay first I 100% agree the whole Hank Pym slapping his Janet always being brought up is stupid and annoying.

Now to really begin I find it very unfair that Hank is always remembered by people for slapping Janet and creating Ultron and his mess ups and writers don't mention any of the stuff he did good , it isn't fair to Hank's character.

Like as a example Spider-Man is my favorite Super Hero but I will be the first to admit that he fucked up quite a bit and hurt a lot of people.

It is known by almost every single super villian in NY that if Spider-Man is pissed run away or hide because he will hurt you, like yeah his loved ones where hurt because of some one but still he does messed up stuff and leaves many people with a fear of him.

Second when Doc Ock was trying to marry Aunt May he beat Doc Ock so bad he was institutionalized and had arachnaphobia.

Third when Doc Ock kidnapped Normie, Spider-Man was letting Shocker drown and then broke his hand and threatened to use his gauntlets on him.

Fourth he beat beat Electro so bad that he hung Electro arms on Electrical wires at a NY power plant haveing Electro being ina endless loop of being Shocked absorbing it and letting it go back into the wires and being Shocked again until he passed out and was still going through that proccess while unconcious.

Their are many other things he did that I didn't list, but why aren't they being brought up all the time it'a kinda unfair to  Hank, by Marvel comics logic Spider-Man should constantly be reminded that he has caused a lot if villians to fear him , that Tony Stark being a dick during Cival War , Black Panther doesn share the cure for cancer with the world, that Black Widow still kils people while still beinga Avenger , that Spider-Man procrastinates to the point his life in not in  some kind of order , or how about how Cyclops lets his emotions to himself not relax that he has a mental break down and goes all terrorist , or how Captain America didn't help the mutants sooner , or Wolverine is a killer and still a X-Man and Avenger.

Can everybody who see's this please comment what other heroes did and or do but is isn't mentioned enough.",Marvel

I want to understand two things, first, is there a reason for Marvel loves those heroes? and second do you like these heroes and do you think they are overrated too???",Marvel
Honestly I think the Thor Franchise is a very poor adaptation,"If given to the right people The Thor Franchise could‚Äôve done some really great imaginative movies but it seems Marvel just isn‚Äôt willing to commit to the comics. Like look at Dr strange I would‚Äôve loved to have seen Derekson do a Dark and Atmospheric Dr. Strange film. We won‚Äôt get that. 

Thor 1 I love personally. People keep saying Thor was boring on earth and I‚Äôm like that‚Äôs because the movies don‚Äôt do interesting things with Thor on earth especially in Dark World. Thor 1 I thought worked perfectly fine. Straczynski‚Äôs Thor proves all of those Naysayers wrong. The entire run is set on earth and about Thor learning how to work along side humans and Asgardians. Also Magic just being high tech science I don‚Äôt like but easily could‚Äôve been retconned. 

Jane foster (I love you Natalie Portman) is actually written like an Adult who divorced her husband just because she heard Thor came back and slapped him for only coming to her about info on his people and not about reconnecting with her gasp ! Actual character depth for Jane foster! She apologized for her behavior and moved past her emotions instead of being annoying and one note like in the Thor movies. 

Dark world is how it is due to being micromanaged to death. The everyone knows the problems with this movie. Malekith is uninteresting, pointless filler that doesn‚Äôt do anything interesting with Thor. The fact people say this movie is Dark is hilarious it‚Äôs soo goofy on a comedic level it clashes with rest of the film it‚Äôs not Dark. Dark is X-men 2, Days Of Future Past, The Wolverine, Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, Nolan‚Äôs Batman those are dark. Thor 2 is overly goofy with some serious moments peppered in. It also watered down the comics Malekith is evil and cunning. I would‚Äôve forgave them not using the casket of ancient winters if they did something interesting with infinity stone. Also in a World where iron man 3 and Avengers existing prior the lack of being restrained in terms of being more out there like the comics is just dumb imo. 

Ragnarok attempts to be more like the comics but what Taika doesn‚Äôt understand is that when you fold in the cosmic elements with the Lord of the rings Magical elements you have to make something that‚Äôs tonally consistent and a story that makes sense and weaves into each other Thor only goes on planet hulk to pick up friends and for a third act fight. There is no story connection thread like how Thor‚Äôs quest to get a new hammer is fueled by his rage and grief to kill thanos there‚Äôs a character motivation and there‚Äôs a goal so it makes more sense when that plot thread connects to another than in ragnarok where the planet hulk stuff has no barring on the main plot with Hela while also being tonally inconsistent. I understand changes happen in comics but when you change soo many fundamental elements to the point where I don‚Äôt recognize it‚Äôs just saddening.",Marvel

Agent Carter / Howling Commandos Series Idea: Fighting Marvel's Superpowered Nazis," 

Hello!   I thought this would be a fun idea, considering that Hayley Atwell is  still heavily involved within the MCU despite the first Agent Carter  show being cancelled.  I actually liked the show (I love period pieces),  but the show did get admittedly off-track with itself and was limited  by a more television-centric budget.

With  the arrival of Disney+, there could be potential for Agent Carter and  possibly the Howling Commandos to appear to Marvel audiences again -  this time with a bigger budget and hopefully a more cohesive story.

XX

While  I'm not too into the minutia of the story, I think an Agent Carter /  Howling Commandos tale could be fun to allow for a return to the  period-era Captain America villains that couldn't be touched upon due to  a lack of Disney+ and Steve Rogers being sent to the present.

Instead  of focusing on HYDRA, which was a Nazi offshoot that went and did its  own things, maybe the show can focus on actual Nazis, possibly in a  post-war setting or late-war setting post-Captain America being frozen.

XX

While HYDRA in the comics was the main Nazi-ish organization, there is also the group Axis Mundi ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Axis\_Mundi\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Axis_Mundi_(Earth-616))), which straight-up wants to bring back the Third Reich Neo-Nazi style, or even ICON ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/ICON\_(1950s)\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/ICON_(1950s)_(Earth-616))), which was originally a US branch that was established by Operation Paperclip that turned against that era's Avengers.

XX

The  nice thing about this idea is that a lot of these folks are pretty  obscure overall, allowing for a pretty good retooling while keeping some  iconic parts to them for the comic fans.  Some ""fun"" Nazi villains our  heroes can fight include:

Master Man ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Wilhelm\_Lohmer\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Wilhelm_Lohmer_(Earth-616)))  - Created by the Third Reich as the Nazi Captain America through the  use of their own Super Soldier Serum, he actually exceeded Captain  America in overall strength, though he was considered pretty dense in  terms of intelligence.

Warrior Woman ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Julia\_Koenig\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Julia_Koenig_(Earth-616)))  - Having initially worked as a Nazi agent in America, she tested a  variation of the Super Soldier Serum on herself and became effectively  the female Master Man, though she isn't as dumb as he is.

Battle-Axis ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Battle-Axis\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Battle-Axis_(Earth-616)))  - Formerly American Golden Age heroes, they were retooled into becoming  Nazi sympathizers during the war.  They're all pretty tacky, though  Doctor Death (later known as Doctor Nemesis) had a lot of involvement  with the X-Men.

Hate-Monger ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Hate-Monger\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Hate-Monger_(Earth-616)))  - Technically a somewhat-clone of Adolf Hitler, he used a ""hate ray"" to  spread bigotry against people to show chaos and discord.  While kind of  on-the-nose as a concept, he could be retooled to something a bit more  subtle, especially in the light of these interesting times.  For  example, he could just go under his ""real"" name Adam Hauser and spread  bigotry through his rhetoric.

Geoffrey Sydenham ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Geoffrey\_Sydenham\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Geoffrey_Sydenham_(Earth-616)))  - The former head of ICON, he was actually a Nazi sympathizer who  started the organization to fight against communism, believing that  fascism was the only way to achieve such goals.  What is interesting is  that he is actually a magic user, brokering a deal with the Dread  Dormammu for such abilities.

There  are a lot of them and some have made appearances in modern comics  (Brain Drain and Baron Blood, for two examples).  Most of them though  were relegated to the war-era comics: [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:National\_Socialist\_German\_Workers\_Party\_members](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:National_Socialist_German_Workers_Party_members)

XX

Besides  Agent Carter, the Howling Commandos and a few returning members from  the Agent Carter show (Howard Stark, Edwin Jarvis), some new heroes  could be introduced to bolster the cast, which could serve as nods to  some notable heroes from the era.  My personal favorites:

Captain Simon Savage and the Leatherneck Raiders ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Simon\_Savage\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Simon_Savage_(Earth-616)), [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Leatherneck\_Raiders\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Leatherneck_Raiders_(Earth-616)))  - Savage was a former submarine commander who founded the Leatherneck  Raiders, which were modeled after the Howling Commandos.  They never  achieved the fame of the latter though.  They could be a rival group to  our heroes as the two could work on missions together.

Jim Hammond ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Human\_Torch\_(Android)\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Human_Torch_(Android)_(Earth-616)))  - The original Human Torch, he was an android who went on many heroics  alongside Captain America.  He also had a son named Toro ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas\_Raymond\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Thomas_Raymond_(Earth-616))).  Hammond at least got a cameo in The First Avenger, so this might be a fun way of bringing him into the MCU properly.

Golden Girl ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Gwendolyne\_Sabuki\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Gwendolyne_Sabuki_(Earth-616)))  - A Japanese-American who was interned at the camps in the United  States, she was kidnapped by the villainous Agent Axis and was going to  be subjected to experiments when Captain America freed her.  While  fighting the Axis agents, a canister exploded and gave her the power of  light projection, allowing her to fire bolts of energy from her hand.

Human Top ([https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/David\_Mitchell\_(Earth-616)](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/David_Mitchell_(Earth-616)))  - An African American civilian, he was kidnapped alongside Sabuki by  Agent Axis and was exposed to the same canister that exploded during  Captain America's brawl with the agent.  The explosion gave him the  power of super-speed when he spun fast.

There  are also a lot of these folks too - both superpowered and regular  heroes.  The good number of them made appearances in the Modern Era as  seniors at the Valhalla Villas retirement home in Florida within the  Ant-Man comics: [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Valhalla\_Villas](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Valhalla_Villas)

There is also the legendary Invaders team that was very active during WW2: [https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Invaders\_(WWII)\_members](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Invaders_(WWII)_members).  While Namor was a part of all that action, I think he is an individual who should get a film dedicated to his greatness.

XX

What  do you guys think?  Do you guys think this is an interesting idea?   Would the use of actual Nazis be too controversial for Disney+?  If so,  do you see the idea playing a lot better on Hulu?  Would you make the  series during the war, late war post-First Avenger or post-war?  What  would you guys like to see in regards to this idea?  Discuss below!

"The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes tie-in comic, are ALL of the issues collected in trades?","So I remember watching The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes back on Disney XD back in the day and it's so good, I really wanna watch the show again and I can't wait to marathon it again when it comes out on Disney+, hopefully. 

But then I remembered I looked the show up on Marvel Wiki and found out last year that the show actually shares the same universe as Wolverine and the X-Men (another show I use to watch) as Earth-8096 (In case anyone's wondering, NO, The Spectacular Spider-Man isn't part of that universe. It's in it's own universe as Earth-26496) and also Hulk vs. and Thor: Tales of Asgard, and of course, the meat of this topic, the four-issue ***Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes Vol 3*** and the eighteen-issue ***Marvel Universe: Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes vol 1*** comics.

Even though Marvel doesn't do these anymore, I still wanna read these and see if anything new came out of them (no spoilers BTW). Do all of these issues come in trades and where can I find them? Or do I have to collect them individually on eBay or elsewhere? Please let me know. Thanks",Marvel

My history with Marvel,"OK. When I was a kid, I was raised on DC. I watched Super Friends on Toonami when I was 2 years old and started reading the comics when I was 5 or 6. The first time I heard of anything Marvel related, it was trailers for Spider-Man, the 2002 movie, on television. I also remember Toonami reviewing the tie-in video game. Back then, I was like ""What in the world is Spider-Man?"" and I actually was kinda interested in it, but I never had the time to go see it or the sequel, which came out two years later. I *did* watch Hanna-Barbera's Fantastic Four on Boomerang, and that's all I ever knew of Marvel (at the time, I didn't know it was Marvel.)

In 2006, I went to Universal Studios on one of our vacations. There, they had the Spider-Man ride, the Hulk coaster, the Storm ride, and the Doctor Doom ride. I went on each and every one of them even though I didn't know who they were (except for Doctor Doom, as I had seen him on the FF cartoon), and I found myself enjoying them. Nevertheless, that'd be just one occasion.

When the MCU started up, I didn't really care for Marvel as I knew DC better. I only knew the characters from the Universal park. In 2014, though, I started watching the Spectacular Spider-Man, at the recommendation from a friend. It was pretty good, but after I was done watching it, I forgot about Marvel yet again.

Cut to 2019. I suddenly got interested in Marvel after years of not caring about it and only being slightly interested in the characters, because of Avengers: Endgame and the hype surrounding it. I started watching the MCU in order, all the way to Spider-Man: Far From Home. I loved it! I fell in love with the characters and even learned about some I never knew existed. I started catching up on everything Marvel related I could, like the old cartoons and comics. Now I'm a big Marvel fan in addition to DC, and it's awesome. My favorite characters are Black Panther, Storm, and Scarlet Witch.",Marvel

Had a thought about the future of the MCU and Secret War.,"Its clear that the next phase in the MCU is primarily going to deal with the multiverse, starting with the upcoming Doctor Strange 2. With this direction and Fantastic Four confirmed to be in the works, I think its pretty clear that this'll lead to the eventual introduction of Doctor Doom and the adaption of the (2015) Secret Wars comic. 

Obviously there will be some creative liberties with the general storyline and in my opinion, one of the biggest should be the threat that's unraveling the multiverse; the Beyonders. Introducing an alien race that's just naturally on a different reality warping level as the Infinity Gauntlet might get messy and just not have the same oomph as the IG buildup that took years. 

I say scrap the Beyonders, we already have the multiversal threat we need for Secret Wars. What if that iconic scene where Doom and Strange face off against an army of Beyonders is instead a coalition of alternate universe Thanos, each armed with an infinity gauntlet they've assembled. Strange himself looked into an absurd number of alternate timelines and confirmed that pretty much the majority them lose to Thanos. 

This cabal could form directly after the events of Endgame with the younger more brutal version of Thanos winning in the climatic end, but not being content with forming a new universe. They have to win everywhere, including those few universe where other Thanos have failed, so they come together to effectively rewrite everything.

From there Doom halts their plan with the help of Strange and probably Molecule Man (Who was hopefully introduced in FF) and Battleworld shenanigans ensue. 

TLDR: Bring back the big California raisin to replace ominpotent ETs in the cinematic universe.",Marvel

Let's discuss the future of the Hulk,"I wanna have a discussion over what you guys think is going to/should happen with the Hulk in either the comics or the MCU. Personally the Hulk is my favorite character so that's why I want to have this discussion.

Personally I want to have a new more powerful version of the hulk arise, possibly the arise of the Devil Hulk. He is one of the personalities of Bruce Banner and the most evil/chaotic personality he has. The other hulks have to hold him back so he can never surface into the real world. It could be a series or just a one off comic but they would to make it long and intense (lol). I know the devil hulk has been in a comic but it would be cool to see him surface and reek havoc in the Galaxy. Killing off big name characters and making him an extreme threat.

Fire based heroine recommendation,"My almost 5 year old daughter roleplays with her friends and pretends to have fire powers.

There are some other minor characters like Magma or Firebird but I don't know if there are any books where they have a primary role.

Does anyone have suggestions on some books featuring stories where the primary heroine has fire powers?

Help finding a poster?,"So this is really specific and probably a long shot, but I'm looking for a poster that shows up in one of Nick Spencer's ""Secret Empire"" issues.

It's in the style of an Uncle Sam poster, but it has Cap pointing with text that reads ""Captain America wants you to hail Hydra!""

I just want to know if there's a real-world replica of this somewhere out there that I could potentially purchase, I think it would make a fun addition to my other obscure Marvel stuff.  If not, then perhaps somewhere I could have one made?  A particular artist I could commission for it?  Etc?

Just got my hands on The Immortal Hulk #1 at 8.5 CGC to add to my collection.,,Marvel
What if Mr. Immortal was combined with Madcap?,"Title. Was wondering what would happen if Mr. Immortal and his powers were combined with Madcap's powers? Since Madcap's regeneration is so extreme it would (probably?) be impossible to kill him, so would Mr. Immortal's powers be nullified? Madcap has been disintegrated before, but somehow (came back to life?/regenerated?). Does that count as dying, if so Mr. Immortal's power would activate, but since Madcap's powers are regeneration was he dead in the first place? Would it even be possible to kill Madcap? What counts as ""death"" in Marvel comics? I assume decapitation wouldn't activate Mr. Immortal's powers then. So if we say that disintegrating Madcap wouldn't count as death and therefore wouldn't activate Mr. immortal's power, what would? Would it require a reality warper? Would that count as death, and even if it did, would Mr. Immortal's power activate?

If all this was considered, would you guys choose the Mr. Immortal + Madcap combination, or would you stick with only Mr. Immortal since Madcap's powers almost nullify Mr. Immortal's. For example if someone beheaded you and stuck your head in an infinite regeneration loop to trap you, wouldn't it be better if you only had Mr. Immortal's powers? In quite a few scenarios it would be better to simply be able to die and activate Mr. Immortal's powers. So the question is (Mr. Immortal + Madcap) or Mr. immortal?

Would you like to see other ""Life Story"" stories for characters/teams in this world? Personally, I think Fantastic Four: Life Story could be a great spinoff from this.   

Throughout the book, we get to spend a bit of time with Reed Richards, and find out that Sue Storm left him for Namor. With that and Doom conquering the earth post-Civil War, I believe there's a very interesting Fantastic Four story in this universe that we've only seen glimpses of so far.",Marvel

End Game quip,"So I'm watching End Game again and something just struck me as off...

The Avengers just went back in time to get the stones, Stark, Ant Man, and Captain just got to New York in 2012. They made a point to let us know they only have enough Pim particles for 1 trip each. This is the most important mission ever literally!!
Yet Tony and Scott are making jokes in the middle of it! Kind of pissed me off that they weren't taking it more seriously. The comedy of the series has always been one of my favorite parts and the one liners and jokes in these scenes from 2012 New York are great. But with so much at stake I feel like these guys would have been more on edge.

Small quip with a series of movies I love deeply and in no way diminishes my enjoyment but I just wanted to point this out.
