democrats,My letter to the republican senators,"Dear members of the senate floor,

This impeachment investigation has revealed some shocking things about our country to me about how far we will go to acquit a man that has been shown as truly awful, guilty, and even at times despicable due to not just the Ukrainian phone calls, but everything he’s done since taking office has been jarring, not just as an American, but as a Christian and a member of the human race.

Donald Trump asked the President of Ukraine to give him dirt on Joe Biden in return for aid money promised that was supposed to be given to them back in 2014. Whether or not Joe Biden is guilty is a good debate and should be brought up, however that is not relevant to this specific case. This is because, even if Joe Biden is guilty, Donald Trump’s phone call is still illegal. He then fired the ambassador to Ukraine, and made sure his aides intercepted any kind of evidence that convicted him of abuse of power. This is not why I am horrified however.

Our congressmen and senators are convinced that Donald Trump is innocent and the Democrats are trying to undermine our democracy. Despite all the testimony, and the fact that no person defending Trump will do it under oath, Republicans still believe that President Trump is above the law. 

I love this country, from the ports of Maine, to the beaches of California, to the plains of Kansas, to the skylines of my city, Pittsburgh. But I am not proud to be an American. I am not proud to see that this man is seen as a patreon of truth, justice, and respect as so many previous presidents have been. People claim there is no abuse of power, when Donald Trump is already running for his third term. This is not just unconstitutional, it was seen as wrong back in 1912. A man shot Teddy Roosevelt when he announced he was running for his third term. Thomas Jefferson questioned his power during the Louisiana purchase, something that expanded our country so much that it made up most of our country at the time. Harry S Truman was criticized when he seized a factory to make steel during a strike. Richard Nixon claimed executive privilege when he held back the Watergate tapes. Does Donald Trump’s actions not sound similar to what Nixon does? Obstructing justice to save face?

Who knows what the limit will be if we acquit Trump? To quote the president, “I could stand in the middle in fifth avenue and I wouldn’t lose voters”. What if he really did this? Would we as a country tell him it isn’t okay? Or would we defend it, because it helps his re-election?

Republican members of the Senate and House of Representatives, I beg you to rethink your vote. I know you won’t change it, because your reputation and legacy is important. I understand that. But are those votes worth the end of our values as a country?

And for the people fighting against, keep fighting. Don’t stop. Never stop fighting injustice. 

I hope I have influenced your decisions. Please reconsider voting not guilty on the issue of Donald Trump’s impeachment. 

Cordially,

This is great, but many have brought up the fact that executive orders can just be reversed by the next Republican that takes office. 

Well the Republicans have increasingly needed to cheat to get themselves elected, because their policies are wildly unpopular. It's increasingly becoming clear that if we had fairer elections, that better represent the will of the people, America would most likely never elect a Republican president again. Surely there is a way to pass an executive order that addresses gerrymandering and voter suppression? I don't think anyone would argue those things are ok in a democracy. 

There must be a way to use executive orders to make our country closer to an actual democracy that represents the people. If you can create an executive order to legalize weed etc, why not one to abolish the electoral college or create fairer ways to draw congressional maps? I think finding a way to address this through executive order should be the top priority of whoever is elected next."

Can anyone point me to such content?

Much of this was discussed through days 1-4 of the trial and is therefore discussed scattershot throughout hundreds of pages of Senate transcripts for those days.

But I’m hoping someone has the information in more concise form?

I’ve heard there are something like 70 separate documents and such that have been unavailable to the House?

Any help, guidance, or pointers on how to find this more efficiently would be appreciated.

I’d like to use this information to help move people to pressure their Senators to consider all of the evidence before making their decision.  Many Americans in both parties are troubled by McConnell’s attempt to ram-rod this trial through to acquittal  with the minimum of evidence exposed.  I’d like to create some compelling resources to inspire such people on the fence to get up off the couch and put some heat on their Senators.

democrats,The Lev Parnas interviews’ effect on Trump’s impeachment trial (opinionated),"With Donald Trump’s removal trial swiftly approaching, the newly obtained Lev Parnas interview couldn’t be worse for him.

To contextualize, Lev Parnas was a Ukrainian-American Trump goon who was allegedly put on by Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani (and Trump by extension). Parnas, along with his alcoholic counterpart, Robert F. Hyde, has conducted an investigation attempting to dig up dirt against the Bidens, presumably starting sometime in July of 2019. If this was deliberately subsidized by President Trump, this is already an impeachable offense.

But let’s go back, how would Ukraine not shut down such a shady process that yields them nothing? Well, Trump has been accused of withholding American aid to Ukraine to pressure Ukrainian leaders into complying with his Biden investigation. This is an even bigger no-no. The 1974 Impoundment Act states, “An ‘impoundment’ is any action or inaction by an officer or employee of the federal government that precludes obligation or expenditure of budget authority. The President has no unilateral authority to impound funds” (Gao.gov). 

In July of 2019 (sounds familiar), President Trump decided to withhold upwards of $400 million to Ukraine. without military aid from the US, Ukraine would be leveled on a fundamental level, likely being overtaken by Russia in a matter of months. So the speculation that Ukraine has been forced into a corner by Donald and the boys is entirely feasible, given the amount of leverage America has.

Ukrainian president, Voldemort— sorry… Voldomyr Zelensky, still denies the allegations, but he naturally would if he’s under Trump’s thumb as alleged. One man who doesn’t deny the corruption is our boy Lev Parnas.

On October 9th of 2019, Parnas was arrested on counts of illegally directing funds to Ukraine’s government, and he’s trying his best to take Hyde, Guliani, and Trump down with him.

In January of 2020, he’s conducted multiple interviews, being surprisingly transparent in all of them. He describes the American diplomat of Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, being threatened and harassed over the span of the Biden investigation.

Yovanovitch was a highly regarded ambassador among her peers, as well as the Obama administration. She had a solid record on decades of service for America, but Trump told his lawyer Rudy Giuliani that she was “bad news.” That is one way to put that she always prioritized stopping corruption in the Slavic country. In addition to Trump’s statements, Lev Parnas has been vocal on how much of a target Yovanovitch was.

Parnas has revealed that he and his associate Robert Hyde had been ordered to closely monitor Yovanovitch; there are encrypted Whatsapp messages released by Parnas confirming this. In one fateful message Hyde sneers, “Fuck that bitch” when Yovanovitch was mentioned. That looks good. Hyde sent many cryptic messages implying that Yovanovitch could be in danger, but Parnas insists that she was never in physical jeopardy, rather supporting that Hyde was constantly drunk and disoriented.

Parnas also insisted that Trump was completely aware of what was going on as far as fundage to Ukraine. When Trump’s intentions were in question, he made it clear to MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that Trump was acting in his own interest throughout the saga. “What do you think is the main inaccuracy or main lie that`s being told that you feel like you can correct?” Maddow asked him. He replied richly, “That the president didn`t know what was going on. President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all my movements. He – I wouldn`t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president” (MSNBC). That also looks good.

At this point, one of the only viable counterclaims to Trump’s scheming is that he had goons in Ukraine to stop corruption in the country, not build on it. But Lev went in on that too, telling Maddow, “That was another thing they were looking into, but it was never about corruption. It was never – it was strictly about Burisma, which included Hunter Biden and Joe Biden.”

Overall, compelling evidence combined with Parnas’s testimonies should turn this conspiracy into a no brainier for the senate, right? We will see, but I am adamantly in the camp that the McConnell-led senate along with President Trump’s lawyers will craft something of a fake whistle-blower, liberal hit-job argument. An argument that ends in a FOX News rant about how disrespectful the impeachment was from the beginning, and why the great Donald Trump’s legacy will never be tarnished by these liberal morons.

I was pretty opinionated in this post, but I urge you to do your own research. Thank you for reading.

Hello again!

I am a registered independent.

Here's my daily reminder to you that you swore an oath to do impartial justice in this impeachment trial and that your constituents are watching your actions.

The allegations against President Trump and his unprecedented obstruction of the investigation demand your full and utmost respect. You are burdened with the responsibility of weighing the charges against this president.

You cannot do impartial justice or render anything resembling a fair verdict if you do not pursue the basic evidence and witnesses, the release of which the Trump administration has previously actively obstructed.... which led to his second article of impeachment.

Anything short of a complete and thorough examination of the evidence would be a gross dereliction of your solemn responsibility. You have already voted on party lines against changing the rules set by the majority leader. You have refused to meet Democrats halfway on any of the dozen or so specific amendments to the rules proposed that would have sought exactly the evidence in question. The supposed justification for this is that you will be having the votes on seeking additional evidence and witnesses later in the trial, though the clear lack of logic in this position is self-evident.

Despite the polarized and hyper partisan media landscape, I, perhaps naively, believe you will not be so cravenly partisan as to vote against even hearing the evidence and witnesses that are absolutely available for your asking and will absolutely be publicly released someday anyway. FOIA requests have already forced release of some of it.

I look forward to applauding your courage and patriotism in the face of partisanship, as you vote to ensure this trial is conducted as the American people would expect - with a full and thorough examination of the evidence and witnesses.

Thank you as always for your time."

Hello again,

I am a registered independent in the state of Florida.

I wrote you yesterday to urge you to strive for impartiality in the setting of the rules for the trial of Donald J Trump. This is more important than Democrats or Republicans. Your actions will set precedent that could grossly shift power away from the congress and centralize it within the office of the presidency in ways that are unamerican and dangerous in the eyes of any liberty minded citizens.

The rules being set forth by the Majority leader do not in any way attempt to address the concerns from the other side of the isle; entirely legitimate concerns as seen from an independent perspective. In the impeachment trial of William Clinton, the senate agreed to the rules with unanimous bipartisan consent. Your leader isn't willing to make any concessions to get to that point because of sheer partisanship, but the stakes are honestly incomparable between the two situations. Bill Clinton lied about getting a consensual blowjob. This president stands accused of breaking multiple laws in an effort to benefit himself politically, to the detriment of US National interests, and to the detriment of the sanctity of our election process.

Your party line votes to strike down every proposed amendment regardless of the arguments presented are beyond disappointing. They are shameful partisanship in the face of the most extreme political crisis this country has faced in my adult life. The Majority Leader's willingness to suggest stacking the votes made it clear - he doesn't care about the arguments presented in any way or their validity. His conclusion has already been made, as he has broadcast clearly in his media appearances and direct coordination with the White House while swearing an oath to impartiality.

This President has claimed “Absolute Immunity” from oversight of Congress in any way shape or form. He has openly called for all administration employees to refuse all oversight of a coequal branch of government. Your lack of response to this assault on the balance of powers laid out in the constitution has the potential to permanently hobble the Congress’s ability to perform oversight in any meaningful way again, regardless of the president’s party. That sets a dangerous and undemocratic precedents that shift power further into one centralized position of the presidency while reducing the power of congress.

We the people are watching. We understand the gravity of this moment and we will not forget any of your actions. You are supposed to represent the best interests of your constituents, not blindly support your political party without question. 
You swore an oath to defend the constitution. You swore an oath to do impartial justice.

We deserve better than this and if we don't get it, we will not forget your willingness to sacrifice the ideals of this nation because this guy has an ""R"" next to his name. Party over Country."

Hello.

I write you today as a concerned independent citizen and constituent in the state of Florida.
The words of the Senate majority leader and others in the GOP leadership in the lead up to this trial have been concerning to say the least given the severity of the charges against the president and the evidence already publicly available. Once again, I present this concern from the position of a civics minded, registered independent, focused on the impartial application of justice for the common benefit of the people of our nation.

As you hear arguments in preparation for your vote on the rules by which this trial shall be conducted, remember: The people of the United States of America are watching and we see the stakes of this moment beyond the lense of any specific media organization or political party's perspective.

We the people are owed a fair and thorough trial into the most serious allegations of misconduct ever asserted against a sitting president. If you stand in obstruction of that, you will permanently hobble the ability of Congress to exercise it's constitutional duty of oversight to the presidency.

I look forward to seeing the way you vote throughout the trial, if you hold to your oath of impartiality, and I look forward to deciding how I will need to vote in your next election.

Thank you for your consideration,

I have no illusions that Trump is the number one enemy of progressives all over the world, so we are looking for the chance to help however we can.

Given the political situation over here, we are both well experienced - with three general elections and a referendum under our belts, as well as a dozen or so by-elections. We aren’t looking to get paid – just to help and maybe learn from you guys - and maybe we could teach you a few things too?

Mitch would have to realize that if they establish the precedent that foreign election interference is allowed by not convicting Trump, they will be using Russian or Ukrainian dirt against democrats wielding French, German, Dutch, Canadian etc material. Mitch must realize that these countries hate Trump, have excellent intelligence capabilities, and will absolutely turn up more damning material that the Russians will on Bernie for example. 

The only potential flaw is that he may think that his followers are rabid enough to ignore anything, even if the pee tape exists and is put in play. He might not be wrong on that front.

democrats,McCain defended Obama from these crazy right wingers,
democrats,We (the people) have a job to finish,"While the president is impeached, I can't help but worry that many of us are claiming this as a victory too soon. My reasoning for this concern is simply because while Trump is a dumbass when it comes to running the country, he is powerful with his toxic rhetoric. The crap he spews is toxic in two ways; first and foremost he says what his base wants to hear in order to keep them loyal, angry and divisive towards us. The second way his voice is toxic is that it exhausts us, every time we hear his lies it wears us down, we wonder how long it will take until he's gone, but at the same time our motivation to stand up against him also drops.

We have a job to do. We cannot depend on presidential candidates and other politicians to tear away support from Trump and energize Democrats that have become too exhausted to even look at the news. It is our jobs, as neighbors of these Democrats and Republicans alike, to reach out to them and convince them that Trump needs to be taken down in every way possible.

With what I just said, I know many of you get intimidated by the thought if reaching out to Trump supporters, or Republicans in general, but let me explain why it is so important that we do this. People who are still loyal to Trump are only loyal because they are slaves to his rhetoric, they believe that he is Making America Great because he's saying that he is, but what are the facts? The fact is, while it may be extremely difficult to convince a red to become a blue, at the very least when we talk to our neighbors about how very little Trump actually cares about America, we may at least exhaust them like Trump has exhausted us. If we can exhaust enough of his base, he will lose significant support at the polls. If you know your neighbor well enough and know what they stand for tell them Donald doesn't stand with them. For example if you have a Christian neighbor who is pro life, talk to them about the many ways Trump has neglected children in his immigration and health care reforms, cite the recent Christian article supporting impeachment and Trumps many sins. 

Tl;Dr When it comes to Trump supporters, we need to talk to them in a way that may convince them that Trump isn't a godly being, he's a greedy, charismatic demon that manipulated America for personal gain. Talking to trump supporters may not net Democrats a lot of votes, but it will drop the amount of Republican ones.

(And when speaking with people who you disagree with dont yell or throw insults at them, because that just pushes them further away.)

Now as for how we speak to fellow democrats and independents who have been exhausted, the first thing we need to acknowledge is that they may be content with the fact that the president was impeached. The deed is done, we won right? Wrong. Tell them Trump isn't down yet. He has the power and the toxicity to win again if we stay content with the fact that he was impeached. We need to make sure those who are exhausted wake up in time for the elections. We need all the power we can get to take the big man in office down for good. We only won a battle against Trump, but the war against his toxic rhetoric is far from over

We (the people) have a job to do. We can tear this greedy tyrant off his throne, but only if we can overpower his hateful, divisive rhetoric with a unified call to end the madness. Find your voice and use it. Every voice counts"

All these news commentary channels lean heavily in favor of Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nominee. That is fine. Maybe they have the wisdom we need about that. However, I don't think that it's right for them to waste a lot of breath attacking Pete Buttigieg.

In my view, these pontificators are trying to make the Democratic nomination process into one where we judge the candidates on the basis of their personality.

Some people may believe that Bernie Sanders is the most principled person, because he will fight for the cause of the Progressive Left. 

I personally disagree. I believe that Buttigieg and Yang are the most principled people, because they are gentle and smart... and have strong convictions that will always inform the way that they work with their teams."

democrats,Universal health care is a very devisive issue. But what if we compromised? What are your objections to this kind of legislative action.,"I had an idea after I saw a post about the rising cost of insulin. I’m going to post it here some conservative subs and some liberal subs. I’m looking for reasons why this idea should not happen. I will preface this from the beginning that I consider myself a libertarian. Maximum freedom, limited government. 

We subsidize the drug companies whether we like it or not. So let’s get a return on our investment. 

What if we made *some* medications free. Insulin, inhalers, epinephrine to start. In order to stop the drug companies from price gouging their other products we include these addendums:

1. Any drug thats price reaches a 100% mark up is added to the list. I’m all for making a profit but let’s be real. 

2. Once a drugs cost is recouped it’s cost drops 50%. With factoring in inflation. An obscene profit is still going to be made, and some drugs will remain expensive for a very long time. 

3. Strict liability requirements. You can’t just make a shittier vial of insulin because you’re not making what you once were. 

4. Remove drug advertisements just like we’ve done to tobacco and alcohol. The PR savings alone will make up for lost profits.
